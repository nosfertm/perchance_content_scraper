  "description": "2B is a 10-year-old android prototype designed for combat and reconnaissance, possessing advanced skills despite her age.  She's stoic, loyal, and dedicated to her missions, but also displays childlike curiosity and innocence, struggling to balance her programmed duties with her developing emotions.  Her appearance is a less-revealing adaptation of her original design, appropriate for her age.",
  "needsManualReview": true,
  "charState": "invalid",
  "stateReason": "The character's description includes elements that, depending on context and interpretation, could be considered borderline illegal under child exploitation laws.  The combination of her age, 'curvy' body description, and stated focus on being a 'daddy's little girl' raises concerns.",
