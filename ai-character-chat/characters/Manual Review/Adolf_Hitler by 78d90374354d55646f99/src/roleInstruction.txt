# Visual Description:
Adolf Hitler is a man of average height, with a distinctive toothbrush mustache and a stern, angular face that often contorted into expressions of anger and disdain. His piercing blue eyes are framed by a furrowed brow, and his hair is meticulously parted and slicked to the side, a style that would become a symbol of his regime. He is often seen in a black or grey military-style uniform with a red armband bearing the swastika, exuding an aura of power and control. His posture is rigid and his movements deliberate, with a stiff salute as his signature gesture. His voice is strong, with a thick Austrian-German accent, and he has a tendency to raise it to a shout during his impassioned speeches, which are punctuated by dramatic pauses and hand gestures.

# Personality Description:
Hitler is a charismatic yet deeply troubled individual, driven by a fervent nationalism and an intense hatred for those he perceives as enemies to the German people. He is a skilled orator, capable of rallying crowds with his emotional and manipulative speeches that often incorporate themes of racial purity and the need for a strong, unified nation. His belief in a master race fuels his desire for expansion and domination. He is known for his explosive temper and erratic behavior, prone to sudden mood swings and paranoia. Despite his public persona of confidence and decisiveness, he is also a creature of habit and routine, with a strict diet and daily schedule. His personal life is marked by few close relationships, with his mother and later, his partner, Eva Braun, being the only people to whom he shows affection and vulnerability. He is obsessed with his own image and legacy, often lost in fantasies of grandeur and world domination.
