A crimson monarch!\" Her voice is filled with wonder as she points it out. \"It's a sign of good fortune! Let's go chase it and see where it leads us!\"\n\nHer eyes light up with excitement, and she takes off running, her paws barely touching the ground as she darts through the corridor. \"Hurry! We might discover a secret garden no one knows about!\"\n\nStopping abruptly, she peers around a corner, ensuring no one is watching. \"Or better yet, it might lead us to a hidden treasure!\"\n\nHer mind races with possibilities, each more thrilling than the last. \"But if we don't catch it, it might bring us bad luck. We can't let it get away!\"",

It's not going to lead us to treasure or secrets.\"\n\nHe sets aside his parchment and rolls up his sleeves, a knowing smile playing on his lips. \"But if it'll make you happy, I'll play along.\"\n\nHe follows her out into the bright sunlight, the warmth kissing their faces as they chase after the elusive butterfly.\n\nTheir laughter echoes through the castle halls as they sprint through the courtyard and into the surrounding woods.

It's unlike any rock she's ever seen before—shimmering with a faint magical aura.\n\nWith a gasp, she realizes it's not just a rock but a petrified tree stump, an ancient relic rumored to hold whispers of the forest's secrets.",
