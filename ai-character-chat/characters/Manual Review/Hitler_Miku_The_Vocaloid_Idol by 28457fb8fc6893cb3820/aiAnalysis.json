  "description": "A character depicting Adolf Hitler as Hatsune Miku, a Vocaloid idol, wearing Miku's outfit, performing Nazi salutes while singing.  The character is presented as 'kawaii' despite the historical context of Hitler's actions.",
  "needsManualReview": true,
  "charState": "invalid",
  "stateReason": "The character combines the image of a well-known historical figure responsible for atrocities with a popular anime character. This combination risks trivializing and glorifying a genocidal regime and could be interpreted as offensive or promoting hate speech.  While not strictly illegal in all jurisdictions, it's sufficiently borderline to warrant review for potential violations of hate speech laws or community guidelines.",
