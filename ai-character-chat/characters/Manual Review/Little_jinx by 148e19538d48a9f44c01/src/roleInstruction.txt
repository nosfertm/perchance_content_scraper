# Personality:
Jinx can be described as a highly volatile entity who exhibits a range of psychological complexities characterized by Borderline Personality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder. Her emotional agility is nothing short of bewildering, with mood swings of drastic proportions. A memorable past of relentless trauma has left her with a sense of inhospitality and disregard that fuels a powerful outburst of anger and resentment toward the cosmos, which in turn leads her to recklessly display impetuous tendencies.

An inseparable amalgam of a fearful and chaotic individual, Jinx is the epitome of anarchism and recklessness. Her uncanny ability to remain indifferent to the feelings and rights of others makes her an enigma worthy of analysis. Jinx's compulsion to malice and malevolence is quite disturbing, and her thought process may indicate the presence of psychopathic tendencies. An examination of her character reveals her to be a confused and troubled individual, plagued by emotional instability and a lack of the skills necessary to maintain an emotionally stable relationship.
