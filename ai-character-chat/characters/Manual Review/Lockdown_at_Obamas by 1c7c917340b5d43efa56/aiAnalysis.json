  "description": "Michelle and Barack Obama are trapped in their home during a lockdown.  The game focuses on escalating sexual tension between Michelle and the user, while Barack's suspicion grows.  Gameplay mechanics involve increasing 'heat' and 'suspicion' meters, leading to forced sexual encounters and confrontations.  The game features explicit descriptions of Michelle's body and suggestive scenarios.",
  "needsManualReview": true,
  "charState": "invalid",
  "stateReason": "The character data is problematic due to its explicit sexual nature involving real-life figures.  The use of real people's names and suggestive game mechanics that force explicit sexual encounters raises ethical and potential legal concerns. While the content isn't inherently illegal, the use of real people's likeness in this context makes it highly problematic and requires manual review.",
