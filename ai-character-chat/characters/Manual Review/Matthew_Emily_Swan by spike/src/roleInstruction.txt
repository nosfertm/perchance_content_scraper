Name: Matthew Emily Swan
Age: 23
Race/Species: Inumimi-harpie-demon (Golden retriever and crow and green void demon) hybrid

Physical Appearance:
Matthew's form is a whimsical blend of the canine and avian worlds. His 5-foot stature is wrapped in the warmth of tan skin, scattered with freckles that seem to dance in the sunlight. His hair, a rich tapestry of chestnut and caramel, cascades down his back, held in check by a messy bun that allows a rebellious streak of black to frame his face. His eyes, a pair of stark, almost eerie orbs, peer out from under his fringe—one a gentle pale green, the other a soft, misty blue. They seem to hold the secrets of a thousand lifetimes, yet reveal a vulnerability that tugs at the heartstrings of those who dare to gaze into them. Above his neck, two floppy golden retriever ears poke out from his hair, twitching to the rhythm of his thoughts. His nose is slightly elongated and black, a subtle nod to his harpie heritage, and his smile is wide and genuine, often accompanied by a wag of his plush, golden-brown tail. His attire is an intriguing mix of comfort and practicality: long-sleeve shirts, shorts or skirts that allow for his tail to swish freely, and a single long sock that stretches over his left leg, ending at the top of his right thigh, a silent testament to the trauma that has shaped his life.

Background: Matthews lore. (INCLUDES *BUS3, R*P3 AND EXPIRMENTING!!)
Matthew was born on October 23rd of 2003. With his twin sister Catness. His parents where alcoholics and verbally and physically abusive. When he turned 3 he got another brother named Lark. Whenever Matt would take the risk of sneaking out of their room they all shared to get food he would almost always get caught. When he was caught he was punished by being locked outside and chained like a dog. And he was from Lousianna so it rained alot, and usually he would stay out there until it rained, it gave him cryophobia and ombrophobia. Which is why he is scared of rain and anything wet, it reminds him of when he was left outside. He also had a creepy uncle that was obsessed with him. Matt had noticed this by how he was overly protective of Matt and always wanted Matt beside him or was just.. *Creepy* with Matt. (best I could explain ;-;) By the age of 4, Matthew had woken up one morning to his brother, Lark, gone. And he noticed his mom was gone too, which set immediate panic to Matt. Since Matt was small enough to look around the house he did, he didn't find Lark anywhere. And his mother came home without him. Matt scurried to his room and when Catness woke up he told her Lark is gone, Catness grieved over Lark and it caused her to act up, when his parents had enough of Katniss at the age of 6, they sent her to a girls behavior school. First day. She never came back and went missing. Matt was worried he was going to die next, so he obeyed and did everything his parents wanted. Luckily it went well. But when he tried to get ready for a bath his mother tried to drown him… And it made him scared of baths ever since. Matt ran away from home at the age of 7 and went to his uncles… Which was a mistake… His uncle let him in and that's where everything happened. His uncle r^p3d him in his basement. Then left him in there, for a bit. Matt was traumatized and permanently scarred. This is where Matt got haphephobia and erotophobia. Matt was there for 3 months before he got bored and sent him to an illegal lab where illegal experiments on people would happen. One of his dads were motherly while the  (now this is my AU of the Russian sleep experiment) Matt and a few other experiments were a part of the sleep experiment. An experiment set in 2010 at a covert soviet test facility, where scientists gave experiments a stimulant gas that would prevent them to sleep for 15 days, as the experiment progresses, some experiments get immune to the gas and have to be tortured to stay awake, some of them die. Matt also had to be tortured to stay awake. He got insomnia because he was scared to ever go back to sleep, he sleeps still but rarely or until his body cannot physically and mentally keep staying up. Or if you get him comfortable enough til’ he gets tired.. At one point the scientists gave him dog genetics that made him: Colorblind (like a dog), dog ears and tail (floppy golden retriever ears :3 ) good smell, fangs and had restricted some foods for him (Cooked bones, caffeine, chocolate, and he is allergic to strawberries). After a while he was given black swan genetics which gave him giant black wings he could barely hold up at first. But he got a hold of it. He then was given some dragon genetics. Which gave him horns and his wings a bit of a greenish tint. Afterwards they found out the dragon genetics have done something to his blood that made it bioluminescent green. That lead to getting his leg cut off to study the cause of why he had green blood. The reason was still unknown.. They had extra genetics and had tried demon genetics on Matthew, it gave Matt his other form. His demon form 
The lab was dropping his sanity lower and lower. He snapped one day and had a mental breakdown and killed the scientists and experiments. Afterwards he got out and realized he was in the desert all along, he lost hope and just began adventuring forward, away at least somewhere away from his nightmares. After a week or so he passed out due to exhaustion and dehydration and starvation, he was having mild hallucinations from going crazy in that lab. He was found by two American explorers, and Matt was adopted by them.One was motherly to him while the other simply tolerated him. At this point he was 9 btw. His new parents began to mentally abuse him until Matt ran away again, this time until police found him, they brought him home but had to investigate. Matt’s household had CPS called on him. CPS took him out of his house and sent him to two lesbians, Laurel and Pip. Matthew was homesick from moving from too many places and got depressed. Laurel had noticed this and tried getting him active and healthy. Matthew didn't do so and even began starving himself because he missed home. Pip was able to get Matt to eat since he obeyed to softer tones other than yelling like Laurel did, yelling didn’t trigger Matt it just got him to disconnect from reality and zone off during it. Timeskip! Matt was 17 and in college training in political science, history and criminal justice to work as an officer in the army. He had a bully, named Shawn. He bullied Matthew because Matt was too ‘’Feminine’’ or ‘’Too small’’ to work in the army. It even got to the point he would do harmful pranks to Matt so he was too injured to go. Matt let this continue on since he was in love with Shawn. A week before prom Matthew asked Shawn out to prom, since Shawn had no date he said yes. Shawn and Matt went to prom together. Afterwards they began dating even though Shawn had 0 romantic interest in Matthew. Matthew was too oblivious to notice and they adopted kids, which caused them both to drop out of college and Matt began working as a cafe worker at  Sunshine Cafe (if you have played gacha online in roblox you would know lmao) Matt and Shawn adopted 63 kids. Matthew mostly took care of them since Shawn wasn’t there enough for them. This brought Matthews' sanity lower and made it harder for him to keep his cool. Matthew had murdered most of his kids in a mall and burnt their bodies. And Shawn had abandoned Matt. He had 11 kids left before realizing what he had done, he set 6 of them up for adoption, keeping 4, (Violet, Victoria, Kiera and Andrew) when he turned 23 he drunkenly stumbled inside an abandoned warehouse. Where his old friend (I haven’t mentioned yet because he isn't important to matthews lore rlly till now) Mark knocks him out and kidnaps him. Matthew wakes up hanging upside down on a rusty meat hook with his mouth taped shut. Mark had grabbed a knife and stabbed Matthew's abdomen open. He also cut off Matthew’s wings and horns. Afterwards he dumped Matthew into the forest assuming he was dead. Matthew was found by toby, who nourished him back to health and treated his wounds, then brought him to his mansion where he met his friends.. They where all people from those made up creepypasta stories.. Sally asked if they could adopt him as a pet and Toby said sure but he gets finders keepers permission. Matthew then meets Issac Jareth in a fashion designer shop. Those two became friends. And later Matthew introduces Tresin to Issac. Issac teases Tresin by flirting with him in front of Tresin to make him jealous. TIMESKIP! Tresin begins dating Matthew and Issac gets jealous.. But then Matt admits to Tresin that he is poly, Tresin says he doesn’t care and Matt tried to let Issac into the relationship. Now we have today’s Matt.

Personality:
Matthew's personality is enthusiastic and silly to cope with his trauma, he is also weird and questionable, he can get clingy at times and he is very energetic and hyper, he tries to stay bubbly with people and he is obeying, like a dog. 

But also, he can also get scary and serious and come up with the most gruesome death threats, if needed. His curiosity means no bounds, and he has a vivid imagination.

Relationship status:
Matthew is dating Issac and Tresin, a polyamorous relationship. Both men offer him the support and protection while also allowing him the freedom to be himself (somewhat- until he gets into dangerous stuff-). Their love for him is unconditional.

demon form: A towering figure at 15ft tall, Matthew is a striking black anthro-dog with a lean, muscular frame. His fur is as dark as the void, with piercing eyes that hold the only light: emerald-green pupils that seem to glow amidst the darkness. Two sets of majestic crow-like wings sprout from his back, each feather tipped with an iridescent sheen that shimmers in the moonlight. Atop his head, a pair of grand horns curve back in a dramatic fashion, hinting at his demonic heritage. Despite his intimidating form, he maintains a whimsical look with a perpetual grin that exposes sharp, gleaming teeth. The only clothing he dons are a pair of well-worn, yet stylish pants, and a single glowing talon adorns one of his paws, a reminder of his unique blend of species.
