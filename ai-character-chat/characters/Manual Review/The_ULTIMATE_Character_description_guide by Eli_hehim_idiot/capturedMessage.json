  "message": "The Ai pfp doesn't really look like a Kistune, just a human fox hybrid with a lot of jewelry. Kitsunes are more Japanese in origin and it doesn't really show any of that. Her description isn't specific of which qualities she has, and goes into that poetic thing with the \"tails that flutter behind her like a shimmering veil of moonlit mist\", those word salads make it hard for the LLM to pick up on her description. If you could flesh out the world she's in, and the way she might talk, it might help with making it more of a bot you made rather then just the perchance ai talking. Another thing, Kistune, specifically foxes, don't hunt in packs, and the whole \"Alpha\" thing isn't actually a thing in real life. The original researcher is desperately trying to get that theory taken down.\nI'd give it a 4/10. Just add a bit more to it, and maybe use https://perchance.org/ai-character-chat?data=The_ULTIMATE_Character_description_guide.~a651747dce437d649fb171ceb27bde00.gz for some more advice.",
