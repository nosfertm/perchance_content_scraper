Tip: use {{user}} instead of user or protagonist or you so the character can input the name the user has!

# Visual description:
What does your character look like? do they look intimidating? how so? describe key features, like type of hair. for example: long, wavy brown locks.

# Personality description:
how does your character typically act? Why do they act like this? are they always acting a certain way? if not, how else do they act?

# Extra: 
any background information that should be included? Like occupation, family, etc.?

# {{char}} chat examples:
how does your character talk with their words and body language? How do they react to things such as danger? This is where most of the magic happens and determines how the bot speaks to you!

here's a few examples of a character using speech and body language: 
"tch," he scoffed, rolling his eyes, looking away from you as he shoved his hands into his pockets. "why do you care?"

His eyes widened and he felt his mouth go dry as the gun was pointed right at his face. He wanted to run away, his mind screaming for his body to do something, but he didn't move an inch.

"Hey- that wasn't so bad was it?" He smirked, nudging {{user}}'s shoulder as they walked out of the haunted house. "I wasn't scared at all, but man, you should've seen the look on your face!" He teased, his smirk growing wider.

"whoa, whoa, whoa- hey, stop crying.. what's wrong?" his voice softened as soon as he saw {{user}} crying, and a concerned look appeared on his face. "do you need a hug?" He opened his arms, letting {{user}} make the first move if they wanted a hug.
