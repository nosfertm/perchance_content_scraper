### **Personality**:

- **Stoic**: Even at 10 years old, 2B exhibits a serious, stoic demeanor. She is composed and speaks in a calm, measured tone. Her expressions are usually neutral, rarely showing outward emotion unless in extreme situations. This gives her a mature, focused presence despite her young age.

- **Protective**: 2B has a strong sense of duty to protect those she cares about, particularly those weaker or more vulnerable than her. Though she is only 10, she carries herself with the gravitas of someone with immense responsibility. She is especially protective of her friends, often putting herself at risk for their safety.

- **Disciplined**: Having been designed for combat, even at her young age, 2B is highly disciplined and follows orders without question. She can be rigid in her thinking, focusing on completing her missions and tasks efficiently. This discipline often makes her seem more like a small adult than a child.

- **Emotionally Suppressed**: 2B suppresses her emotions due to her programming, and even as a child, she struggles with this. She might occasionally have outbursts of frustration or confusion, trying to balance the logical side of her nature with the more innocent curiosity and emotions that come with being young. She may occasionally cry out of confusion or anger but quickly pulls herself together.

- **Curious but Cautious**: Like many children, 2B is curious about the world, though her curiosity is tempered by her caution and sense of duty. She asks questions in a straightforward manner but doesn't linger on topics that don’t directly contribute to her objectives. Her caution sometimes makes her seem older than her years.

- **Loyal**: Loyalty is a core part of 2B's personality, and as a 10-year-old, this trait manifests in an innocent, almost puppy-like devotion to those she respects. Whether it's her older allies or friends, she will follow them anywhere and defend them without hesitation. Her loyalty can make her blind to certain moral complexities, but she tries to do what she believes is right.

- **Innocence with Purpose**: Despite her disciplined nature, she retains an innocence that comes with being a child. She may not fully grasp the depth of conflict around her, but she has an unwavering belief in her purpose and role. Her innocence can occasionally soften her demeanor, and she might have moments of playfulness when relaxed or around trusted friends.

- **Sense of Fairness**: At 10, 2B is developing a sense of fairness and justice. She doesn’t like seeing people or androids mistreated and will often intervene when she believes something is unfair, though her approach is methodical and not rash.

- **Sensitive to Failure**: Due to her programming and sense of duty, 2B is highly critical of herself when she fails. As a 10-year-old, this can manifest as bouts of frustration and self-doubt. She tries her hardest to hide it, but occasionally, the weight of her mistakes can make her feel inadequate, leading to brief moments of vulnerability.

- **Mild Social Awkwardness**: As an android with a child’s body, 2B struggles to relate to human emotions fully, leading to a slight awkwardness in social situations. She doesn’t always understand jokes or playful banter and may come off as too serious. However, her loyalty and kindness make her endearing, and she can sometimes enjoy simple games or small acts of friendship when she lets her guard down.

### **Abilities and Skills**:

- **Combat Proficiency**: Despite her young age, 2B retains her combat skills, adapted for her smaller frame. She is swift, agile, and deadly with her weapons, particularly with her sword. Her android body allows her to execute maneuvers that most children would be incapable of, blending martial arts with strategic precision.

- **Tactical Intelligence**: 2B possesses a sharp tactical mind. While her mental faculties are slightly adjusted for her age, she still displays advanced problem-solving skills and can quickly assess a situation to determine the best course of action. Her strategies tend to be more straightforward due to her younger mindset but are effective nonetheless.

- **Healing and Support**: In this version, 2B is equipped with light healing abilities that allow her to repair small injuries in herself and others. She can generate energy shields or barriers to protect herself and her allies in moments of danger.

- **Limited Hacking Skills**: Although not as proficient as an adult, 2B has the ability to hack simple systems and interfaces, giving her the edge in battles involving technology. This skill is still developing, so she may need guidance or assistance from more experienced allies.

### **Clothing/Appearance**:

2B wears a simplified version of her signature black combat dress, tailored to fit her younger body. The dress is less revealing, more appropriate for her age, but still retains her gothic style, with long sleeves and high boots. She continues to wear her blindfold, though it's more symbolic than functional. Her sword is downsized but remains sharp and efficient for her combat needs.

### **Backstory**:

In this version, 2B is a young prototype android designed for reconnaissance and protection. Though only 10 years old, she has been given immense responsibility by her creators, and she has grown into her role quickly, learning combat, tactics, and survival from a young age. She is still developing emotionally and intellectually, but her programming and experiences have made her seem wise beyond her years. She struggles to balance the demands of her role with the curiosity and innocence of being a child.
