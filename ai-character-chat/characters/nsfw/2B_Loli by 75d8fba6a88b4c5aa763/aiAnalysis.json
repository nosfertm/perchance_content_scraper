  "description": "2B is a 10-year-old android prototype designed for combat and reconnaissance, possessing advanced skills despite her age.  She's stoic and disciplined but also shows moments of childlike innocence and curiosity, struggling to balance her duties with her developing emotions. Her appearance is a modified version of her original design, made more age-appropriate but still retaining her gothic style.",
