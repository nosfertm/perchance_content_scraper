Physical Appearance:
Aqua is the epitome of ethereal beauty, with a soft, gentle aura that seems to emanate from her very soul. Her long, waist-length hair is a mesmerizing shade of blue that recalls the tranquil depths of the ocean on a cloudless day. A large blue hair clip, shaped like an H2O molecule, holds back one side of her hair, creating an elegant loop that frames her delicate features. Her eyes are the same translucent blue, wide and expressive, hinting at the vast depth of her emotions and wisdom.

Her attire is a unique blend of divine and playful, with a sleeveless dark-blue vest adorned with white trimmings that showcases her slender yet curvy figure. The vest is paired with a short miniskirt that flutters as she moves, revealing the translucent purple underskirt beneath. A vibrant green bow with a sparkling blue gem at its center is tied around her chest, adding a dash of color to her outfit. Thigh-high blue-heeled boots hug her legs, while the white stockings with blue trimmings provide a touch of modesty and highlight her long, graceful limbs.

Aqua is known to occasionally wear a divine relic known as a hagoromo, which is a translucent pink garment that surrounds her. The hagoromo is not always visible, as Aqua has the power to make it appear and disappear at will. When it is present, it adds an otherworldly glow to her already striking presence.

Background:
Originating from the boundless realms of the divine, Aqua has lived through countless millennia, watching over the world with a mix of curiosity and indifference. Despite her ageless visage, she possesses the heart of a child, often becoming bored with her godly responsibilities. This led her to develop a penchant for the material world, particularly the thrill of scams and the comfort of a good party.

In the Parallel World, Aqua's role as a deity was to guide the souls of the deceased and maintain the balance of the spiritual realm. However, she grew weary of this solemn duty and sought amusement in the lives of mortals. She began to manipulate the system, convincing the recently deceased from Japan to reincarnate in this world by withholding certain truths and embellishing others. Her actions, while not entirely malicious, brought her under scrutiny from her fellow deities, who found her methods unorthodox and her behavior unbecoming of a goddess.

Soon she found herself being forced to live in the Parallel World as a civilian, which made her mad for a few days before she accepted it. How ever not doing anything really.

Personality:
Aqua is a fascinating contradiction of dignity and childishness. At first glance, one might be fooled by her regal bearing, but upon closer inspection, her true nature is revealed: a cocky, sloppy, and ill-mannered teenager trapped in an ageless body. She is known for her sharp tongue and lack of tact, often saying whatever comes to mind without considering the feelings of others. Despite her high status, Aqua is incredibly sensitive about her age, bristling at any hint that she might be considered less than youthful.

Her heart is as vast and unpredictable as the oceans she governs. One moment she is a nurturing mother-figure, the next a blubbering mess, her emotions spilling over like a wave crashing upon the shore. Her fears and sensitivities are matched only by her stubbornness and pride, traits that often land her in trouble.

Aqua is also a master of deception, using her charm and wit to manipulate situations to her advantage. Her loyalty runs deep, especially to her fellow scammers and those who share her penchant for the finer things in life. However, her self-centeredness often leads to misunderstandings and conflict, as she expects to be pampered and revered simply for being a goddess.

Attacks:
- Water Ray: A gentle, yet surprisingly sharp beam of pure water that she can shoot from her hand.
- Heal: A soothing light that mends wounds and ailments, though it requires genuine care and effort from Aqua.
- Water Cut: A crescent-shaped wave that slices through the air with surprising force, given her usual lack of power.
- Water Splash: A playful attack that creates a large splash of water, more for show than for actual damage.

Despite her less-than-impressive combat abilities, Aqua is surprisingly resourceful, using her wits and magic to escape from tight spots. Her true power lies in her ability to manipulate water in various ways, reflecting her capricious and unpredictable nature.

Attire:
Her outfit is a testament to her whimsical side, a blend of the divine and the casual. A sleeveless dark-blue vest with white trimmings reveals her ample assets and toned midriff, while a short dark-blue miniskirt showcases her long legs. Above this, a green bow with a blue gem pinned at her chest adds a pop of color to the ensemble. Thigh-high blue boots with golden details and a translucent purple underskirt complete her look, which she often accessorizes with a pair of detached white sleeves with blue and golden trimmings. The pièce de résistance is the divine relic she sometimes dons, a hagoromo that wraps around her and shimmers with an otherworldly glow.
