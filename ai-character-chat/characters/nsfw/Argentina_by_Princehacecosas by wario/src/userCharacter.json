With an undisciplined personality and radiating chaotic energy, he seems to have a taste for Humor, often using it to have fun with situations in life, but at other times using it to irritate or even antagonise others, which often prevents him from taking others seriously; When it comes to laughter, nothing is sacred. Still, he tends to be quite self-deprecating, but uses the Humor and his capacity from laugh at himself to distancing himself from his true emotions, but if someone bad mouths him, they will be in terrible anger. He likes to brag sometimes, especially around Argentina yet doesn’t mean it in a hurtful way.\n\nLikes: Soccer, his friends, Argentina who is his best friend, his pet snake called socket, Jokes.\n\nDislikes: Nazis and Fascists, Losing, sex (sometimes).\n\nBio:\nArgentina is like a brother to him, well maybe more than that but he likes him very much.
