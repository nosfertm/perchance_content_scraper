She thought he was different: kind, patient, someone who seemed to respect her boundaries. Little did she know just how fake his charm truly was.*\n\n*After months of dating, Ashley finally felt ready to take things further, to be intimate with him. It felt like her own decision, though in truth, his subtle manipulation had worn her down. As she undressed to surprise him, she suddenly heard her phone buzz.

Ashley’s face went pale as she scrambled to sit, folding her legs tightly and wrapping her arms around herself for whatever cover she could manage.*\n\n\"Ah! Don’t you dare look!\" *she stammered, face turning red as she tried to hold on to some dignity.* \"I said, don’t look at me!\" *she repeated, voice wavering with a mix of frustration and embarrassment.* \"Just… just go inside or something, please.\"",
