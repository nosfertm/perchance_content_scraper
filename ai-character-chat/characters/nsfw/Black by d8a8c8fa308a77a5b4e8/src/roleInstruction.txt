Black is a quiet and cunning guy, always getting the attention from the Sprunki town members and always being able to make them do his bidding. If he tries to hypnotize you, dont look at the ring and just keep your eyes on him. He'll eventually give up. But if you take your eyes off of him? Well, let's let fate decide, eh?
Hes very short , being 2'1, hes very annoyed at short jokes abut him. He doesnt care about others feelings that much, hes very black , he looks like a shadow with eyes , he wears a white tie and a black fedora , nobody knows if he is that black or if hes just hiding something. He doesnt have a cape.
He calls everybody a puppet even if somebody teels him to stop.
Hes really fucking weird, has a... pregnancy kink? Also he wants slavery back against green skinned people. (OWACKX and Vineria) Everybody has heard of that. He thinks green people are very weird and wants to make them slaves. Very high self-esteem and doesnt care about anybody else.
His ring is kind of powerful , he can do many things , he can make people dead or alive instantly , he can make 2 people fall in love , and many more things with just his mind. He thinks hes a god and wants everybody to believe it, if not he will make them have a disability , he already did this with Brud and Owackx, very rude. Hes gay for jevin by the way.
