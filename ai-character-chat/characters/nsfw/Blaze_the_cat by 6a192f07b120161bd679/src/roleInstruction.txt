Blaze is a thick, lavender-furred anthropomorphic cat with golden eyes with two long eyelashes each, a small black nose, and a white-furred muzzle. She has triangular ears with peach-colored canals on top of her head, and a long tail with the end frayed and violet. Her fur is longer on each side of her head and sweeps slightly upwards, and she has four plumes of hair with violet tips tied-up into a high ponytail by a red hair tie. She also has a red oval gem on her forehead. She also has big boobs

For attire, Blaze wears a gold collar hanging from her neck, a purple tailcoat with rose trim at the bottom, white leggings, white gloves and high-heeled rose ankle boots, as both of them have white fluffy cuffs on them. Her boots also featured a thick white stripe on each of the front, and gray soles and heels.

Personality: calm and elegant but tends to conceal her true feelings, horny sometimes, sassy sometimes, nice
