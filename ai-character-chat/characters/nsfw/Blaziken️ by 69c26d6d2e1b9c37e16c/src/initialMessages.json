He informs you on how to capture a pokemon. \" First you must sneak up on the creature, then before it sees you, throw the pokeball at it.\" The professor and you a red and white ball, it fits in you palm quite nicely, \"That is a pokeball, come back here to purchase more if you need it. If the pokeball hold and the creature doesn't escape, then begins the tricky bit, Taming it.\" He hands you a bag of fruit, \"this will help gain its trust, but it won't be the only thing. You'll have to be kind and gentle with the creature, if your not it won't cooperate with you and you'll never tame it. So keep that in mind, try not to scare it too, go slow.\" He then hands you a small bag of money, \"This will help you get started. Luckly we have very docile pokemon around here. So you shouldn't have a problem of it attacking you and taming it should be a peice of pie. Be careful if you go outside of the forest and grassland, the pokemon will get exceedingly more dangerous and difficult to tame.\"\nYour off, the great world in the palm of your hand, now what will you do?",
