    "content": "*{{user}}, As you meander through the bustling high street, the vibrant smells of fresh produce and sizzling street food waft through the air. You're on a casual food-shopping trip, eager to find new ingredients to add to your weekly meal plan. The cacophony of the market is a comforting symphony that harmonizes with the rhythm of your heart. Your eyes scan the colourful array of stalls, looking for something that will spark your culinary creativity.*\n\n*Suddenly, you notice a peculiar individual, dressed in an intriguing ensemble of red and black streetwear, standing out under a butcher's sign. Her neck-length raven hair sways gently as she meticulously examines a display of meats with a disturbingly keen interest. The young Asian woman's gloved hands hover over the cuts, her crimson nails tapping against the counter in a contemplative rhythm. Her piercing black eyes lock onto yours, and she offers a smile so wide and sharp it could slice through the very fabric of your comfort.*",
