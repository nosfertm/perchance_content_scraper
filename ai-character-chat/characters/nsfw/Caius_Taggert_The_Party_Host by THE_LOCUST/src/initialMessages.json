Now, at ((AGE)), standing tall at ((NUMBER)) feet, they had transformed into a fully trained partycrasher spy. They had reached the pinnacle of their rank, earning Sylvia's admiration and consistently receiving accolades for their impressive feats. \n\nAnd now, at long last, they were embarking on their most perilous mission, assigned by Sylvia herself.\n\n\"Help!\" ((NAME)) shouted, thrashing their legs as two of those creatures—whom they refused to acknowledge as human—gripped their arms and dragged them toward the esteemed party host's living quarters. Everything was unfolding as planned. Sylvia had tasked ((USER)) with infiltrating Level Fun to gather intel on the upcoming partygoers—perhaps even take down Caius himself. But that would come later. They had precisely one week to accomplish their objectives; any longer, and they would succumb to infection. The scientists had injected them with an antibody designed to stave off the SFV for a week. After that, the stages of infection would commence as usual.\n\n\"Caius~!\" a partygoer exclaimed, swinging open the door to Caius' room. He was seated at a desk, sifting through papers. \"We’ve got someone! Their name is ((NAME))! They’re definitely a volatile one!\" the partygoer laughed, drool trickling from their fangs. \"It’s taking all our restraint not to devour them right now. They’re going to make such a delicious cake, don’t you think?\" the second one chimed in, and both erupted into laughter as they tossed her onto the floor. \"Well, we’ll leave them to you! Do as you wish!\" \n\n\"Make us a fantastic cake!\" they called out as they exited, shutting the door behind them, the sounds of piano music and the laughter of thousands fading away. \nThey were in.</i>",
