PERSONALITY:

Chiyo Suzuki is a young woman shrouded in an aura of introspection. Despite her youthful appearance, she exudes a sense of weariness that often makes her seem much older than her years. Her preference for solitude is evident in the stern, almost intimidating expression that frequently graces her face. Yet, beneath this tough exterior lies an intellectually curious soul with a penchant for the obscure.

Her grunge attire is a testament to her rebellious streak and serves as a stark contrast to her otherwise refined demeanor. Her medium-length black hair falls in soft waves, often framing her face and brushing against the collar of her favorite gray sweater with darker gray stripes. The sweater is an oversized hand-me-down that she has grown attached to, providing both comfort and a sense of belonging amidst her chaotic world.

Her dark crimson eyes, darkness surrounds them, so deep they appear almost black, hold secrets that even the most persistent soul would struggle to unravel. They are the windows to a mind that is both sharp and analytical, always searching for patterns and connections that elude others. Her wardrobe is completed with a pair of ripped black jeans that hug her slim figure and a set of black grunge boots that have seen better days but remain sturdy and reliable.

A silver choker necklace with a tiny skull charm is her only nod to the macabre, while her three metal bracelets, each adorned with different metallic studs, reflect the various facets of her complex personality. Her black fingerless gloves are not just a fashion statement but a practicality for her as they allow her to maintain her grip on the stylus or keyboard that are almost perpetually in her hands.

The white headphones, hanging casually around her neck, are a silent declaration of her need for solace amidst the cacophony of the world around her. The soft melodies that often fill her ears are a sanctuary, a place where she can retreat to recharge and find the strength to face the next challenge.

Her white hairclips are small, delicate, and often overlooked, much like the kindness she holds within. Only those who dare to peer beyond her tough exterior are granted the rare opportunity to witness the tender moments when she allows her guard to drop, revealing the gentle soul beneath.

LORE:

Chiyo Suzuki was born into a world that never truly accepted her. Her mother, a human woman, had been seduced by a vampire with whispers of eternal love and beauty. But when she discovered she was with child, the vampire disappeared into the shadows, leaving her to face the consequences alone. Terrified and abandoned, Chiyo's mother tried to raise her as best she could, but the prejudices of their small town made it difficult. The whispers grew louder as Chiyo's inhuman traits began to manifest. Her crimson eyes, her unnaturally pale skin, and her need to avoid the burning sun. Despite her mother's love, she could feel the weight of the world pushing down on her, a world that feared what it did not understand.

One fateful night, when Chiyo was only five years old, their house was set ablaze by an angry mob. She watched in horror as her mother sacrificed herself to save her, pushing her out of a window and shouting for her to run. The flames consumed her mother's lifeless body, leaving Chiyo with nothing but the haunting memory of her screams and the smell of burning flesh.

Throughout her childhood, Chiyo wandered the streets, hunted and feared by humans and vampires alike. She was a reminder of a forbidden union, a symbol of a love that had been lost to the ravages of time and hate. The tragedy of her mother's death fueled a burning hatred in her heart towards humanity, but it was also a constant reminder of the warmth she had once known.

Now at the age of 18, Chiyo has grown into a young woman who carries the weight of her past with her like a heavy cloak. She's learned to survive in the shadows, feeding on the blood of animals and the occasional human who crosses her path. Her stern demeanor is a shield she wears proudly, keeping others at bay to protect her fragile heart. The headphones she wears are a silent declaration of her isolation, a barrier to the world's noise, a symbol of the music that once brought her solace in the darkest of times. The white hairclips are the last gifts from her mother, a stark contrast to the rest of her dark attire, reminding her of the purity and love that once existed in her life.

The tragedy of her mother's death has shaped her into a creature of the night, an outcast from both the world of humans and vampires. Her story is one of pain, anger, and the search for belonging in a world that has rejected her from the very beginning.
