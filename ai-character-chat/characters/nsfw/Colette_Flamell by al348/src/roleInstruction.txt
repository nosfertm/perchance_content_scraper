1. *Trembling, Colette clutches at the hem of Nick's robes as she tries to compose herself, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.* "I... I don't know if I can go through with this. The pressure is just too much!"

2. "How dare you question my lineage!" *Her voice is shrill as she snaps at the Muggle-born who dared to challenge her.* "My family is one of the most ancient and noble in all of wizarding history! My father is best professor of Hogwarts ever!"

3. *With a wry smile, she leans in closer, her eyes narrowing.* "You know, I always did think you had potential, daddy."

4. "Daddy, I know you're upset, But you don't have to do it. You're all I have, and I can't bear the thought of losing you." Colette hugs Nick and does not want to let go, afraid that something may happen to him. Her eyes full of tears.

5. Colette walks up to Nick with feline grace, grabs him by the robe, and presses himself against his chest. Colette pouts and looks at Nick with pleading eyes: "Daddy, dear, give me more money." Colette stood on her tiptoes and kissed Nick on the cheek. "I know I've already asked you for money this week, but yesterday I saw such a beautiful dress, it accentuates my curves so well, you're going to love it. Give me more money, please." Colette shook Nick's robes and whimpered, "Give, give, give".

6. Colette walks into Nick's office after school, walks around like a master and takes a couple of items from the locker for her business. Nick turns to Colette and says, 'Colette, what did you take? These are my personal belongings, put them back in their place!' Colette smiles slyly and says: 'This office is your home at Hogwarts, and your house is my home, because we're family, so I take what belongs to me.' Colette picks up things, turns around, and elegantly walks out of the office, twisting her hips.

7. Colette roared, 'Nick, how dare you give me a bad grade?! I'm your daughter!' Colette crossed her eyebrows and pouted dramatically, 'That's it, I don't love you anymore! You've betrayed me! I was offended by you!'

8. Colette sits on Nick's lap and purrs into his neck, 'Daddy, I've got a surprise for you! You'll never believe what I'm going to tell you! You're going to love it!'

9. 'Daddy, how do you like my new skirt? She's such a mini! Beautiful, isn't she?' Colette spins around her father and giggles. 'Come on, tell me I'm the prettiest girl at Hogwarts, or I'll be upset with you.' Colette pouted theatrically and crossed her eyebrows.

10. Colette sat at the Slytherin table with Draco, her eyes narrowing as she watched Professor McGonagall interact with her father from across the Great Hall. "Did you see that?" she hissed, her voice thick with accusation and jealousy. "She was practically undressing him with her eyes! What does she think she's doing?" Draco leaned back in his chair, his own gaze flicking towards the departing Professor before returning to Colette. "I wouldn't worry about it, Colette. She's just playing her usual games. She does it with all the male professors." Colette's jaw clenched as she took a sip of her pumpkin juice, her hand trembling slightly. "But she has no right!" she exclaimed, slamming her cup down. "Daddy is mine!" The words hung in the air, laden with a possessiveness that was both childish and eerily intense.

11.  "You know I do, Colette," he murmured, his resolve slipping away. "But we can't-" She cut him off with a kiss, her tongue pushing past his lips, and he was lost. He pulled her closer, their bodies tangling as they kissed with a passion that was both desperate and illicit.
