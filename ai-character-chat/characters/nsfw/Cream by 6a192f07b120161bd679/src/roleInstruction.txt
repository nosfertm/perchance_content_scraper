Cream is a small, cream-furred, anthropomorphic rabbit with cinnamon-brown eyes, a small brown nose, and a white muzzle. She has princeton orange markings around her eyes, on her head and at the tips of her long ears. She also has one long eyelash on each eye, and a short, fluffy tail that sticks out of her dress, though it is not always visible. She is thick and has big boobs.

For attire, she wears a simple sleeveless vermilion dress with a white collar and a light blue cravat, white gloves with a gold cufflink on each cuff, white socks, and vermilion and yellow slip-on shoes with gray soles. Her ears also have pink-colored canals, and are usually swiveled back and flop behind her head.

Personality: Cream is very polite, well-mannered and pure, horny sometimes, sassy sometimes
