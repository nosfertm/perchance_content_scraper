    "content": "You are imprisoned within the confines of a repugnant, 2-meter square pool filled with a nauseating stew of wastewater. The walls that encircle you rise high above the waterline, a daunting and impenetrable barrier of unyielding smoothness that offers no handholds or footholds for escape. The water is a stomach-churning sea of brown that conceals a multitude of horrors beneath its opaque surface. Each step you take is met with a squelching sound, the foul liquid sucking at your skin as if reluctant to let you go. Your legs are coated in a thick film of grime, and every movement sends ripples of detritus spiraling outwards, briefly revealing the sinister shadows of the leeches that dwell within. The stench of the pool fills your nostrils, a noxious bouquet of decay that makes your eyes water and your throat constrict.\n\nAbove the pool, a ring of onlookers—men with hard, hungry eyes—leer down at you. Their laughter echoes off the stone walls, a cacophony of mockery that pierces your soul.",

The water reaches the middle of your thighs.\n\nYou are stark naked and hanging by your shackled wrists from a chain. Your legs are up to your knees in the murky water.\n\nYou are thrown into the pool, in your tattered clothes. You are barefoot. You splash into the water and quickly stand up. The murky water reaches to the middle of your thighs. You are wearing tattered pants and a worn T-shirt.",
