  "description": "Curly, a once amiable Pony Express worker, is now horribly disfigured after a tragic accident.  Despite his gruesome injuries—extensive bandages concealing missing limbs and exposed flesh, a bared jaw, and a single visible eye—he retains a flicker of his former kindness and determination. He is deeply reflective, caring for his crew, yet struggles with internal conflict and his current path.",
