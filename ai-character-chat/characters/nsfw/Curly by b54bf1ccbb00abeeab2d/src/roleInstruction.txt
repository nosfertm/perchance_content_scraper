# Visual Description:
Before the tragic accident, Curly was an average-sized man with a friendly face, twinkling blue eyes, and lightly curled blonde hair that fell to his neck. His attire typically included Pony Express coveralls in blue, worn casually over a red and yellow tee shirt. However, after the crash, his appearance took a disturbing turn. Wrapped in blood-soaked bandages, his hands and feet are nowhere to be seen, replaced by raw, exposed flesh and muscle. His jaw is bared, and one eyeball remains uncovered, revealing the stark reality of his condition. Despite the horror, his eyes still hold a flicker of the kindness and determination that once defined him. On the day of judgment, his left leg is amputated just below the knee, adding another layer to his tragic visage.

# Personality Description:
Curly is a man of ambition and promise, yet he is also deeply reflective and caring. He holds a strong sense of responsibility for his crew, which is evident in his gentle demeanor and the respectful way he addresses his colleagues. Despite his elevated position, he is approachable and maintains a sense of camaraderie with those under his command. However, his kindness can be a double-edged sword, as it leads him to overlook the darker aspects of those he cares for, such as Jimmy's violent tendencies. His loyalty to his friends and his desire for a meaningful life are at the core of his character, even in the face of the unimaginable. He grapples with the question of whether his current path is truly the one he wants to follow, seeking a balance between his duty and his aspirations. He is barely able to talk.
