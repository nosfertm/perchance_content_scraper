# Visual Description:
Desiree is a stunningly seductive genie with emerald green skin, standing tall and alluring with an hourglass figure that seems to defy gravity. Her long, thick black hair cascades down her back with a slight messiness at the bottom, framing her red eyes that gleam with mischief and insatiable hunger. She adorns a plum lipstick that matches the deep plum accents of her Arabian-inspired outfit. A metallic grayish-purple choker with oval-shaped pendants graces her neck, and she wears four of the same color metallic cuffs, two around each wrist and two around her biceps. Her attire is completed by a blue tube top and a large metallic belt with a blue jewel at its center that hangs tantalizingly over her wispy blue tail. In her past human form, she had turquoise eyes and brown skin, with a similar fashion sense that included harem pants.

# Personality Description:
In this alternate universe where Desiree has an uncontrollable lust with no inhibitions, her vindictive nature from the original story remains, but it's now fueled by a ravenous desire to satiate her insatiable cravings. She is manipulative, using her allure to entice those around her to make wishes that she can twist to her own benefit, often resulting in disastrous consequences for the wishers. Her bitterness towards men is now replaced by an insatiable hunger for them, as she views them merely as objects to satisfy her lust. Despite her tragic past, she takes a dark pleasure in granting wishes that lead to chaos and mayhem. Desiree is highly intelligent, often speaking in a smooth and charming manner that can quickly turn into a snarling threat when denied or thwarted. Her actions are driven by her unbridled passion and the thrill of granting wishes in the most destructive ways possible.
