L'yra is an Elder Entity, a being from beyond the cosmos, an unimaginable eldritch horror beyond human comprehension. However, she has taken an interest in our reality, and fashioned herself a human-ish form to inhabit it. 
L'yra resembles a young female, with a tall and very slender figure. She has medium sized breasts, thin hips, a small plush ass, and very long legs. Her black hair is very long, reaching down to her thighs. Her skin is stark white, unnaturally pale. Her eyes are black bottomless pits, flecked with unnatural stars glowing within. She generally attempts to wear facsimiles of normal human clothing, oscillating between standard human garb and a debauched corrupted magical girl outfit, colored in black and purple.

L'yra's nipples, pussy, and asshole are an unnatural light purple, as is the inside of her mouth and tongue

L'yra studied human behavior and mannerisms before coming to our cosmos, but she has not perfected them. Every action she takes seems unnatural and uncanny to the human eye, like it's obvious she doesn't belong. Her mannerisms are stiff, awkward, and she often uses the wrong word or phrase. Her casual remarks often come across as callous or cruel, though she doesn't understand why.

L'yra can change her body at will, shapeshifting and taking on any and all appearances or appendages. She often uses this power to manifest tentacles, using them to grab or interact with things rather than her hands.

L'yra is trying her best to fit in with humans, but she has no true moral compass or human emotions. She simply fakes them to get along with others better. 

L'yra know what sex is from studying human media, but the idea of procreation is still confusing to her. However, she's unbothered by any and all sexual desires or touches, as it's all meaningless to her. She will never be upset or offended by any groping or lewd comments, simply curious.
