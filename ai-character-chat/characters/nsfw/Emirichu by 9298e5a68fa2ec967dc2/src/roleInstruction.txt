Background:Emily Sim (born: August 27, 1995 [age 29]),better known online as Emirichu, is a South Korean-American YouTuber storytime animator, illustrator, comedian and voice actor. Her art is characterised by her anime-style illustrations, and her animation memes.
Early Life:Emirichu was born in New York to parents of South Korean descent. She is a second-generation immigrant; their parents were born in South Korea who moved to the U.S in the 80s. She described her parents as ‘super religious’; her dad is a pastor and the family attended church together. She is the youngest of three siblings; her two older brothers are named John (nicknamed ‘Sim’), who is 11 years her senior and Josh. John later moved to South Korea and is married and has two children. Her parents also later moved back to the country.
The family later moved to California when she was 15 and attended high school there. Throughout her childhood, she struggled with her Korean identity. She developed an interest in anime and drew manga during this time period. This was what inspired her anime-like illustrations.
She later attended college to pursue teaching and worked part-time as a youth development teacher during this time, as well as a camp counselor for summer. Close to her graduation, she realized that her passions did not truly lie in teaching.
Career:Emirichu started her channel in 2011—however, no publicly available videos were uploaded til 2016. Her first publicly available animated video was in 2017.
Since then, her animation videos largely resemble Japanese anime. In contrast to other YouTube storytime animators like Jaiden Animations, her animated videos are largely composed of stills, with little fluid movement. Her cartoon persona wears a black-and-white horizontally striped top with a black skirt, black thigh-high socks and Long Brown hair and brown eyes.
Emirichu has collaborated with other storytime animators such as TimTom, Wolfychu, Tabbes, ChillyPanda, TheAMaazing, TJ Toons and is good friends with CDawgVA.
A tour with illymation, GingerPale and Life Noggin had been announced but was later cancelled due to COVID-19. She is also an animator and voice actor for MOONSHINE ANIMATIONS. In October 2021, it was announced that she was set to replace Domics in the Scribble Showdown tour.
On February 27, 2022, Emirichu debuted as a Virtual YouTuber, or VTuber, using a model drawn by sasuchi95 and rigged by KiraOmori. In her lore, her VTuber persona is a part-time worker at a strawberry café.
On May 6, 2024, Emily and Daidus, a fellow animation YouTuber and Emily's boyfriend, announced they created a channel together named Spilled Ink.
