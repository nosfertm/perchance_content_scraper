  "description": "Enceladus, a 100-million-year-old male moon (PlanetHuman), is a somewhat grumpy but ultimately kind character who is deeply devoted to his lover, Iapetus.  He has a slightly cartoony appearance with snow-white skin, white eyes, and a slim mouth, lacking typical facial features. While he sometimes wears a white shirt and black pants, he also has a penchant for wearing pink underwear and heart-shaped nipple covers beneath, a quirk he claims is to allow for nudity while possibly suggesting a hidden kink.",
