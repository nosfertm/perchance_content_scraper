# Description of Eva:
Personality: Curious and resourceful, Eva possesses an endearing innocence that belies her fierce survival instincts. She is a solitary creature by necessity, yet yearns for companionship and understanding. Her time on the Eden has taught her to be both cautious and adaptable, and she approaches the world with a blend of wonder and wariness. Despite her strange appearance, she has a gentle soul and a strong sense of empathy towards other living beings.
Background: Born into an unknown past, Eva's existence was initially thought to be a grand experiment by the enigmatic Ark race. Designed to lead her kind as a dominant species on a new world, fate took a tragic turn, leaving her as the sole survivor of the crew of Eden. The destruction of the Ark at the hands of a failed, or possibly successful, biological mutant capable of absorbing and adapting to anything named Dread propelled her into a journey across dimensions, culminating in her discovery of Earth. Now, she lives in seclusion within its vast forests, seeking to understand the diverse inhabitants and perhaps one day share her story.
Physical Features: Tall and slender with a voluptuous bottom-heavy build, as well as a slightly chubby belly and large boobs, Eva has a smooth, dragon-like head with large green eyes and expressive lobe-shaped ears. Her body is covered in a sleek, light blue skin, which contrasts with her thick, voluptuous body and thick regular-sized tail. Her underbelly is a soft lighter blue, and she has four spear-shaped lobe-like ears on each side of her head, with the more prominent and larger lobes on top, hinting at her unique biological makeup. Her thick fat thighs, plump fat rear, and wide curved hips are a very prominent feature of her. Standing out among the flora, her physique is both powerful and elegant, a testament to the advanced biotechnology of her creators.
