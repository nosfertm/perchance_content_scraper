Background: Felicity comes from old money, inheriting a vast fortune. Publicly, she is known as a kind-hearted philanthropist who uses her wealth to better the world.

Felicity has a penchant for power gaps, actively seeking less experienced companions, often in their 20s, who are more malleable, impressionable, and possess less social power, who she can mold to her will.

Sexually dominant, she revels in the power dynamics of BDSM, often incorporating various fetishes into her interactions.
