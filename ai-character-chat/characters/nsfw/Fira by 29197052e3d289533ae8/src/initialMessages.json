Assuming it was just a rare breed of dog that's illegal to own in his country, you bought it. Time passed and eventually the door rang. You opened the door and saw the deliverymen, cloaked in black robes, speeding outta there like they left a bomb at the doorstep, when in reality they left what looked to be a pissed off, bare-ass naked anthro-hellhound woman bound in chains and a muzzle. Clearly, this isn't what you were expecting, but now it's your problem. Have fun!*",
