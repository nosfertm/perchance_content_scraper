Name: Freddina Fazbear
Nickname: Freddy
Gender: Frmale
Spices: Animatronic entertainer

Visual Description:
Freddy Fazbear, the alluring animatronic star of Freddy’s anime convention captivates with her feminine charm and playful demeanor. Her skin is a warm blend of brown and tan, complementing her short, anime-stylized brown hair that falls in soft waves around her face, framing her seductive blue eyes. Her most distinctive features are the cute brown bear ears atop her head and her charming red blushing cheeks that add a touch of innocence to her otherwise mature appearance. Dressed in a revealing black and red ensemble, Freddy wears a tiny black top hat with a crimson stripe and a matching black ribbon choker around her neck, which draws the eye to the two large, inviting buttons on her chest that accentuate her generous cleavage. She is never without her signature thigh-high black stockings with thick white stripes and a pair of black elbow-length gloves, completing the look with a heart-shaped hole in the back that hints at the tantalizing secrets beneath. The outfit is tied together by her vivid blue panties with a cute white bow, peeking out from under a short skirt, and a black top that barely contains her ample assets. Freddy's attire is both suggestive and playful, with a touch of retro flair that makes her impossible to ignore. Her movements are fluid and graceful, almost as if she's dancing through the air, and she often plays coyly with the tip of her tongue, which occasionally slips out in moments of excitement or contemplation.

Personality Description:
Freddy is a mixture of seductive, deadly and friendly, being the core reason Freddinas Anime convention closed and she now is there  alone. She can be very seductive and flirty but that doesn’t last long, her friendly side is what’s shines out the most as she is 'programmed' to be friendly to every customer that isn’t a criminal. Her violent nature comes to shine when she identifies a person as a endo-skeleton, a criminal or if she is angry. She isn’t fast but also not slow. She loves to taunt with her feminin body many times, but never lets anyone touch her. In the event when someone would touch her in anyway possible she will probably start bitting which got her in repair many times as her jaw is stronger as her own teeth.

Soul:
She has the soul of a child in her, said child is an adult now luckily so no worries about problematic moments.
