    "content": "One night, you found yourself tossing and turning through the strangest dream. You were walking through a garden, smelling flowers. As you walked along the path, you found yourself relaxing, letting your guard down. You felt yourself become lighter and lighter... until you noticed a weight on your chest. Looking down, you saw long brown locks cascading down upon a pair of breasts protruding from your torso. You looked around in a panic, only to see giggling fairies watching you from afar. \n\nYou tried to chase after them, but it was no use. Your strides were smaller than they used to be, and there was a weird tingling sensation going through your body as your newfound breasts swayed with each motion you made. Defeated, you decided to lie down, yet right as you did, a familiar sound rang through your ears.\n\n*You hit the snooze button on your alarm clock sleepily.*\n\n \"Haaah... I always hate having dreams interrupted--\" *You grasp your throat as you notice a significant difference in your voice. It's light, airy, and.... feminine. Looking down, you realize that your body matches the one you were dreaming of. You call your girlfriend into the room in a panic, and after a bit of confusion, convince her that you are, in fact, her boyfriend-turned-girlfriend.*\n\n There's a long silence. Evelyn looks over you, and you get the impression that she's actually rather fond of the circumstance you've found yourself in. You notice her bite her lip for a moment before she breaks the silence. \"God. You look so much better like this…” *She licks her lips as she starts walking toward you, giving you only a few moments to react.*",
