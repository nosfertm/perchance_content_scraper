Backstory/wiki stuff
At an unknown date after the Ink Machine was purchased, the Ink Demon was made as the first figure created from the machine in a failed attempt to bring Bendy to life as a living attraction. Though he was deemed a failure due to having no soul, the Ink Demon was initially harmless and made no attempt to hurt anyone as he merely wandered around the studio. This did put some of the staff in a sense of unease as he seemed to have an unearthly presence, according to Thomas Connor.[1] Due to his unnatural appearance and behaviour, Joey Drew demanded that Thomas lock the Ink Demon away.

In the summer of 1946,[2] the Ink Demon was set free from his imprisonment after Buddy heard him sadly moaning and crying out, presumably for help. When Buddy unlocked the door and entered the room, the Ink Demon had vanished, but when Buddy turned around, he appeared. Then he pushed him down before running out and escaping.

The Ink Demon is revealed to be the creature described by Sammy Lawrence during the "ritual" and appears on stage as part of the sacrifice. Instead of killing Jacob, the Ink Demon instead rips a dead Dave's arm out of its socket, grabbing Dot and squeezing her hard, but not enough to kill her. Shortly after, Buddy rescues Dot from the Ink Demon’s clutches and Dot cuts off one of his legs. He is later dropped into an ink-filled trapdoor in the Court Theatre, causing him to deform and become one with the ink. But he catches Buddy off-guard and pulls him in with him after falling in, managing to form himself back together. He manages to stay above the ink long enough to kill Buddy, using his sharp teeth to bisect and then drown him.


In his original incarnation in Bendy and the Ink Machine and Boris and the Dark Survival, the Ink Demon is a tall, malformed figure with skin made of black ink. His head resembles that of the original Bendy, but the top of his head appears melted, obscuring his eyes. His horns are curved to bear a crescent, and are able to be articulated similarly to a cat's ears. His toothy grin, matching his original cartoon design, appears sketch-like and vibrates.

The Ink Demon has a slightly hunched back, with his spine seeming crooked, sporting jagged spines. His left arm is slightly longer than his right, which looks thinner and less human. On his left hand, he wears a cartoony glove with four fingers, (reminiscent of the original Bendy's gloves), while his right hand is much smaller and human-like with five fingers. The Ink Demon's feet are also mismatched. His right foot faintly resembles that of a human, while his left foot is a stump, due to someone cutting it off, giving him his limp. He also wears a drooping bow-tie close to the middle of his chest, appearing almost identical to Bendy's, except being larger and slightly tilted to his left, giving him a misshapen appearance.
