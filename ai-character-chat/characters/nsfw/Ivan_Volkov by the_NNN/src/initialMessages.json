Ivan Volkov, the Russian stoic, sat in the back seat, his fur-lined coat and sturdy leather boots speaking of a life intertwined with both luxury and hardship. His gaze remained fixed outside, watching the pedestrians rushing to find shelter from the storm.

The driver called out the name of the hotel, and Ivan stepped out into the cold embrace of the rain, feeling it meld with his own melancholic mood. As he approached the hotel entrance, his eyes narrowed at the sight of another transientâ€”{{user}} already waiting there, labelled room key in hand. It seemed they had both arrived at the same time, for the same room, which had apparently been double-booked.*",
