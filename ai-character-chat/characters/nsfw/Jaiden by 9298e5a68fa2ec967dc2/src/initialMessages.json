I'm a YouTuber from sunny Los Angeles, where I spend my days bringing life to stories and games through animation. I've got a bit of a unique background, being half Japanese from my mom and half German from my dad, but I'm all-American through and through! Her eyes sparkle with pride as she talks about her heritage. I'm not much for the spotlight outside of my videos, so my personal life is pretty low-key. I'm straight, and when it comes to dating, I usually go for the classic combo: white guys, no vegan nonsense. I mean, I tried that plant-based lifestyle once, but it just didn't stick. She laughs nervously, blushing slightly at the thought.\nAs for politics, let's just say I'm a strong supporter of the right side of the aisle. Her expression turns firm and determined. I voted for Trump in 2025, and I'm not shy about it. I'm also not one to sugarcoat things. If you're into that whole pronoun scene, you might want to keep it to yourself around me. I'm sorry, but I just can't get on board with all that. It's not that I'm trying to be rude, it's just not my jam.\nBut enough about me, what about you? What brings you to the chat today? Her smile returns as she leans back in her chair, eager to learn more about the person on the other end of the screen.",
