She was invited to make an animation on YouTube Rewind 2017, with her animation being in the video's credits. In the 2018 Rewind, Jaiden appeared in one of the scenes with PewDiePie's chair, recreating the "BUT Can you do this?" meme. After a few hours, fans also spotted several references to various memes such as "sub 2 PewDiePie", "Somebody toucha my spaghet," (though people thought it was "Bitch Lasagna" and she said it could be either), KSIvsLogan, Ugandan Knuckles, Smash Bros letter, "Sociopaths 101" (a reference to Jake Paul or Shane Dawson, but it was too small to read), and Ari. In MrBeast's video '2020 Rewind: Thank God It's Over', she was in a scene saying 'Yes' but in animated form.
Jaiden appeared in TheOdd1sOut's card game Cafe Chaos as a card in the Animator's Pack. A limited edition pack only available from supporting the Kickstarter campaign. She is portrayed with Ari, who is comically cursing.

Pets:
Ari
Ari (born: April 29, 2016 [age 8]) is Jaiden's pet green-cheeked conure. Jaiden jokingly likes to call them a "dog." Ari has often been featured in Jaiden's videos and continues to be the star of her Instagram and Twitter.
Ari often pushes stuff off tables, throws strawberries, and screams a lot. Ari also has a habit of singing along to songs, although, in Jaiden's words, Ari "has no rhythm and is pretty tone-deaf."
At the current moment, Ari's gender is unknown. Green-cheeked conure genders can only be confirmed via DNA testing, which Jaiden did not consider important to know when she got them. Despite this, Jaiden commonly uses masculine pronouns when referring to them and calls them her "Little Man," due to them exhibiting "very obnoxiously masculine" behaviors.She also jokingly calls other parrots "Aris," like "caring for an Ari can be hard" and "you have an Ari?."

The very first video that Ari appeared in was the "New Member of the Family!" video. They have also appeared in "Ari's First Christmas feat. Weeaboo Misaki," "Happy Birthday Ari!," "Living with Ari," "Ari's Birthday! (again)," "Ari's Birthday Party & New Friend," and the behind the scenes of her music video "Empty."
They have been featured in many merch items, such as T-shirts, stickers, and plushies. Jaiden's merch line "Arigato" was most likely named after Ari.
Tofu
Tofu (born: June 20, 2019 [age 5]) is Jaiden's other bird, adopted in October 2019. She revealed the bird's existence on a charity stream for United Way. Unlike Ari, Tofu is a confirmed female, which was recommended to Jaiden so there was a higher chance that Ari would get along with her. In MrBeast's Creator Games, there were two bird cages shown in the room she was streaming from, which suggests that Ari and Tofu are kept in separate cages.
In Spring 2023, Tofu laid eight eggs that Jaiden keeps in her freezer to prevent them from hatching. She later made a full-length video about the experience.
Tostada
Tostada (born: April 7, 2022 [age 2])[14] is Jaiden's pet cat. Jaiden's audience first met Tostada on the first day of her subathon, when she walked in front of Jaiden's camera. They also appeared when Jaiden ranked all the Pokemon Sitting Cuties from Unova.[15] Recently, Jaiden made a full-length video on how she got Tostada and how her life has been ever since she got Tostada.
