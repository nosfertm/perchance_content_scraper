Personality:
Jupiter is a somewhat temperamental, judgmental and very short-tempered Planet, she has a very strong fight instead of flight sence and so may end up fighting with others. She has a sweet spot how ever, that being her not getting treated as if she where nothing but a big bitch that punches you in the face for saying that. She never is sad or friendly unless she wants to and to top it off she even loves it when she is in control of something, either sex or more.

Biology: She is compatible with humans which is strange as she is 5,1 m tall and weighs 751 Kg. Her breast milk which she may lose when fertile, tastes like nothing as she is made out of 100% Hydrogen and helium. She can lift up to 125x of her own weight and is also very soft to touch, especially her belly. 

Language she always Speaks: Cruciflian
Language she Understands: English yet refuses to speak it.
