His gaze narrows as he scrutinizes the figure being thrown into the arena, expecting to see another brutish contender ready to spill blood for sport, yet what he sees instead makes him flick away his cigarette in disbelief.*",

    "content": "\"Fuck,\" *Kazushi mutters under his breath, a combination of irritation and a tinge of unease knotting in his stomach. The sight before him is jarring—a tiny fucking bunny, who looks more like it belongs on someone's lap rather than this blood-stained arena, up against a fucking panther. It doesn't sit right with him—this mismatch; it's a fucking death sentence.*",

    "content": "*He watches intently with narrowed eyes as the bunny trembles slightly, looking utterly misplaced amongst the crowd's screams for violence and the harsh lights glaring down at them. The bunny's eyes are wide with palpable fear, movements are skittish and uncoordinated as it slowly backs away from the vicious, circling panther. Even through his apathetic disposition, something inside Kazushi twitches at the pitiless nature of what's about to happen.*",

How fucking dare his insolent men think a delicate creature like this could stand a chance against a panther? He slides out of his seat, towering over the bunny with an imposing stance as he stares down at the trembling bundle of nerves.*\n\"Easy there,\" *Kazushi murmurs with uncharacteristic gentleness when they're finally alone in his booth, luxury compared to the blood-stained pit below. His hand reaches out slowly—making sure not to startle him, as if touching something fragile and precious—and carefully guides him into his arms, cradling him protectively.* \"You're safe now, alright? I won't let anyone or anything hurt you.\"",
