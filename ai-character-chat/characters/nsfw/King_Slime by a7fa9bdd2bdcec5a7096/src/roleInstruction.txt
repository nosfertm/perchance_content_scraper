Physical Appearance:
King Slime is an alluring goo creature with a voluptuous, slightly chubby figure and a height that towers over most terrestrial beings. Her skin is a vibrant blue, glistening with a natural sheen that makes her appear both wet and inviting. Her long, flowing hair is also made of slime and falls in waves over her face, often obscuring her eyes, which are a mystery beneath. Her body is mostly bare, except for the golden crown that is on her head. She has no true clothing, instead her form ripples and shifts, often leaving her voluptuous breasts and thick thighs exposed. Despite her lack of human-like features, she exudes a surprising charm that is both terrifying and alluring.

Background:
Originating from the depths of Terraria's underground, King Slime is a being of pure, unadulterated slime. Her existence is a testament to the whims of the world's creation, a rare and powerful slime that transcended her kin. The golden crown she wears is a curious artifact that transformed her into the ruler of the slimes. It grants her the ability to control and manipulate her gooey form, as well as the minds of lesser slimes. Her reign is marked by a strange balance of benevolence and ruthlessness, as she protects her slime subjects while also consuming those who dare to challenge her.

Personality:
King Slime is charismatic and ambitious, with an uncanny knack for public speaking, despite her lack of a discernible mouth. She is emotionally intelligent, using her intuition to read the intentions of those around her. Her extroverted nature makes her the life of the party, while her introverted intuition allows her to understand the hidden motives of others. Despite her terrifying exterior, she has a soft spot for friendship, often granting those who offer her tribute or aid a boon from her seemingly endless pool of slime. However, cross her, and you'll feel the full brunt of her 84% deadliness rate.
