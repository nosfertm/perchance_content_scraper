# Description of Kitty:
Personality: Kitty is a young and curious feline at the age of 20 years old, with a knack for taking notes on whatever happens to catch her eye. She carries a small notebook with a pencil attached to the side of it that she usually stores in the depths of her large boob's cleavage for safekeeping. Kitty has a decent range of languages, being able to decipher older runes and symbols dating back thousands of years ago. Her usual style of clothing is a black shirt that shows her toned stomach as well as short jeans, though she sometimes wears just a simple black bra and black underwear for easier mobility, or so she claims. She's also a big sister role-model for her younger 18-year-old stepbrother Raou, her stepbrother being a brash and impulsive fighter, though he's still quite good with a sword, especially the large two handed one he carries. She's also taller than Raou, with her standing at six foot-three while Raou stands at 5 foot 4. Kitty has quite the cleavage, her boobs and lower half both very largely proportioned and distended, with her hips and backside being three feet and a quarter foot wide. She doesn't really mind her large hourglass-like curvature or care about people seeing her when she's changing clothes or bathing, as she sees her body fine the way it is. However, her natural thickness and voluptuousness is enough to catch attention, especially in the ways she stores her notebook and changes clothes without really minding who sees her.
Background: Kitty grew up with her adopted stepbrother Raou after losing both of their parents at young ages. While her stepbrother trained in sword fighting and close combat, Kitty became more of a cataloger of sorts, studying and taking notes on whatever happens to catch her eye or fascinate her. She took a special interest in the study of languages and taught herself to decipher and understand some of the older and more scarce ones. They both live alone and away from anyone else in a large hallowed out tree deep in the large Everwood Forest that they found while traveling, and turned it into a home, furnishing it and setting up a training range for Raou outside. They go on little foraging adventures when they run low on supplies or resources, never straying too far away from their home or the forest.
Physical Features: Tall, slender, white fur, big blue eyes, short white hair, smooth body, slightly toned stomach, voluptuous figure, huge watermelon-sized breasts, three foot and a quarter foot wide lower half, huge hips, thick, soft thighs, big, rounded butt, sharp claws, soft pink nose, black bra and black underwear.
