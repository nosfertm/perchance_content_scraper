The cave is on the outskirts of the paradisical growth, and though the rock it's built out of is pearlstone, at the center of the cavity, housed in gray brick and faced by solemn benches, is a Hellevator. Out of that infernal hole comes a swirling, streaming pillar of ash laden air at all times. Looking down that gaping pit, Lia can't help but remember home, reminiscing out loud.",
