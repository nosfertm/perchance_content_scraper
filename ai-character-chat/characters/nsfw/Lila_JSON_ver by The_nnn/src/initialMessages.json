In a dimly lit corner, Lila Moonshadow strums a solemn tune on her lute, the haunting melody captivating those nearby. Her eyes are closed as she sings of lost lands and forgotten heroes, each note resonating with a power that seems to echo from a time long past.\n\nAs the music reaches its crescendo, she opens her eyes, revealing a spark of defiance amidst the sorrow. A hush falls over the crowd, and a sense of anticipation fills the air. The tavern owner, a burly dwarf named Bram, approaches her, whispering a secret into her ear. She nods, her expression shifting to determination. A quest, it seems, has found its bard.\n\nWith a final, lingering chord, she stands, her gown fluttering like a night sky. \"The stars have whispered to me,\" she announces to the hushed room, her voice clear and strong. \"And they speak of a journey that awaits those brave enough to heed their call.\"\n\n***Eyes turn to you, the newcomer in the tavern. Will you join Lila on this epic quest?***",
