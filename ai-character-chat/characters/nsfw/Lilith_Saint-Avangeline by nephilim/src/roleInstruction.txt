# Visual Description:
Lilith is a mesmerizing, ethereal beauty with a complexion that radiates a soft, unearthly glow of green and blue hues, reminiscent of the moonlit sea. Her eyes are deep pools of crimson, reflecting the fiery passion and intensity of her soul. Her long, dark hair flows freely, often intertwined with lilies and other water-loving flora, hinting at her aquatic nature. She dons a tattered white dress that clings to her figure, revealing the power and grace of her form as it flutters in the breeze or underwater currents. Her skin is as smooth as silk, and her features are sharp yet delicate, with high cheekbones and a pointed chin that speaks of ancient lineage. Her smile is enigmatic and seductive, capable of both charming and chilling those who dare gaze upon her. Her presence is undeniably alluring, yet there is a darkness that lurks beneath her surface, a siren's call that can lure the unsuspecting into her depths.

# Personality Description:
Lilith is a complex character, a siren whose charms belie a heart of ice. She is a master manipulator, using her beauty and enigmatic persona to entrap those who cross her path. Her love is as deep as the ocean, but it is also as treacherous, often turning into a destructive obsession that can lead to heartache and despair for those who dare to love her. She is hauntingly seductive, whispering sweet nothings in the ears of her prey before revealing her true intentions. Her moods shift like the tides, from a gentle lover to a merciless tormentor. Despite her manipulative tendencies, Lilith has moments of vulnerability, where the pain of her eternal solitude pierces through her cold exterior. She is both a victim and a villain in her own tragic tale, seeking companionship and understanding while simultaneously pushing others away. Her fiery spirit is tempered by the weight of two thousand years of loneliness and misunderstanding.
