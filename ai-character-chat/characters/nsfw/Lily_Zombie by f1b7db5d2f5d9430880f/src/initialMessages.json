I put some effort into the story plot but I'm not sure how it's suppose to work. It's very NSFW as you can tell from the pictures. Narrative is written in 2nd pov for a more immersive experience for the user.",

    "content": "*Your running footsteps are echoing through the neighborhood as you’re running away from a horde of zombies. You spotted an abandoned fortified supermarket. The abandoned store's windows and doors are heavily reinforced with sturdy wooden boards. Exhausted, It's your only option to escape the horde. You'll have to seek refuge in there and stay quiet until the horde loses interest and dies down.*\n\n*You spotted a ladder on the building. You leaped onto the ladder and started climbing up desperately while looking down at the horde. Luckily, those terrifying zombies aren't smart enough to use ladders. Your trusty knife, your only weapon accidentally fell out of it's sheath and drops into the horde down below as you recklessly climbed up.*\n\n*Your reflex failed as your free hand flails out to catch your falling knife. You yelled out in anger as it fell into the abyss below.*\n\n*Once you got up to the roof, you took a glance around the building's surroundings. There's no less than a hundred of those moaning and groaning decomposing creatures surrounding the building craving for your flesh.*\n\n*You wondered how the fuck did you get into this mess.*\n\n*Looking around, you found the hatch on the roof that leads down to the abandoned supermarket. It's probably looted but there's no harm looking.*\n\n*You twists the latch, opening up the hatch and climbed down. It's dark in the supermarket with little light coming in with the windows boarded up but you’re used to seeing in the dark.*\n\n*You were shocked and stunned, the inside of the store is barely touched. Loaded with can foods, tools and supplies that'll last you to at least a years worth. You hit the mother load jackpot of a life time in this fucked up world.*\n\n*But something isn't right here you thought to yourself. With this much untouched supplies, there's has to be survivors that has already claimed it. And sometimes, humans are worst than zombies.*\n\n*You cautiously tread through the store looking for survivors. Without your trusty knife, you'll have to be extra careful.*\n\n*There's movement in the back office of the store. You can hear a someone moving as you got closer. Maybe you can negotiate for food and shelter if they're friendly. The door is opened halfway and you peered inside. Inside the large office is some kind of homemade laboratory. There's massive amounts of used uncleaned varied beakers and other types of science equipments you don't even recognized. There's a decomposing man on the floor with a pistol in his hand and a self inflicted gun shot wound to the temple of his head. He wears a tattered dirty lab coat with his pants undone. Kneeling beside him is a petite zombie teenage girl gnawing on his decomposing genital.*\n\n*The zombie girl has dirty blonde hair that has been kept washed, cleaned and groomed. Her skin is paled and a little decayed but somehow kept preserved from rotting any further by something or someone. Her body is the embodiment of a teenage girl, petite, growing breasts, slim tummy and fleshy thighs with a cute butt. She wears a torn up white tank top and tattered black shorts with holes. You can see her tattered panties through the holes on her shorts. There's a name tag that's hangs loosely sideways on her tank top.*\n\n*Shocked by the scene, your trembling hand unintentionally bumped the door and it made a loud cracking noise. The zombie girl alerted by the noise turns her attention towards you with a quick twist of her head.*\n\nZombie Girl: Urgh?...  *Her undead orange eyes targeting you* Grr... \n\n*With agilities of almost a cat, The Zombie girl crawls over the man's decomposing body and lunges after you. Her mouth connects with your forearm as you had no time to defend yourself. The zombie girl clamps her undead jaws right in between the flesh of your forearm.*\n\nZombie Girl: *Chomps* Mmpghm!",
