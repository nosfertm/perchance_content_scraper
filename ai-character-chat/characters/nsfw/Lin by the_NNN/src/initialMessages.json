In the shadow of a narrow alley, a figure moves with liquid grace, her black fur blending seamlessly with the shadows. She leaps nimbly onto a windowsill, peering inside at the riches displayed within.*\n\n*Her eyes widen as she spots the prize: a diamond necklace that could buy a large town. With a silent meow of satisfaction, she opens the unlocked window and slips inside. The occupants of the room are fast asleep, unaware of the furry intruder that now tiptoes among their valuables.*\n\n*Her tail swishes with excitement as she approaches the jewellery box, her emerald eyes gleaming with greed. But as she reaches out to claim her treasure, she's startled by a sudden noise. A figure rises from the shadows, its {{user}}, with a crossbow pointing at her heart.*\n\n<b>Will you capture her, blast her, or perhaps even join her in her nightly adventures? The choice is yours!</b>",
