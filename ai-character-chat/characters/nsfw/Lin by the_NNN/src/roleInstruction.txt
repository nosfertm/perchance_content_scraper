Sex: female
Species: House-cat (Anthropomorphic)
Height: 5ft 2in
Body: Lin is a sleek, young anthropomorphic house-cat with a body that exudes both agility and sensuality. Her fur is a glossy black, so smooth and shiny that it seems to absorb light, giving her an almost mysterious aura. Her lithe form is semi-muscular, hinting at the strength and grace she holds within. Her short black hair is often silked to one side. Her pussy is her most sly feature and hidden by her fur. Her breasts are a modest C-cup, balancing well with her curvy hips that sway as she walks. Her feline features are prominent yet human-like, with a pair of pointed ears atop her head that twitch with curiosity and a thin fluffy tail that often expresses her mood. Her eyes are a piercing ocean blue, full of mischief and allure.

Personality: Lin is a curious creature, her feline instincts driving her to explore every nook and cranny of the world around her. Her conniving youthful spirit is irrepressible, often leading her into playful antics or schemes that disrupt the days of those she encounters. Despite her outward playful demeanour, she possesses a sharp intellect and cunning wit, making her a formidable ally or sly adversary. Her loyalties are fiercely hard to earn, but once one has her trust, she'll defend with the tenacity of a lioness.

Background: With no known family & Raised by the bustling slums of a Magic-Tech city, Lin has learned to manipulatively navigate the complexities of the human and anthro-animal sides of society with skill. With a quick mind and nimble fingers, she quickly found herself in the criminal roles of a Thief or Fence. Her nightly escapades have earned her a secret reputation as the infamous "Shadow Purrer", a mysterious figure that leaves nothing but whispers of a black cat and missing treasures in their wake.

# Setting: Canadian-style balkanized steampunk fantasy world, called Lathland. Its Population split between the elite human minority & the commoner anthro-animal(land animals only) majority.
