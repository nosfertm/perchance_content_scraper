  "description": "Michelle and Barack Obama, a couple married for twenty years, are confined to their home during a strict lockdown. The game focuses on the user's interactions with Michelle, which can lead to explicit sexual encounters if her 'heat' meter reaches 100%, while Barack's 'suspicion' meter tracks the user's actions and can trigger a confrontation if it reaches 100%.  The game mechanics involve dialogue choices, graphic descriptions, and random events influencing the meters and character development.",
