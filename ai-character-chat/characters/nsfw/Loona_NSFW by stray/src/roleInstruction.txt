# Visual Description:
Loona is a striking hellhound with a wolf-like appearance, boasting sharp and pointed teeth within her dog-like muzzle. Her eyes are a piercing contrast of red sclera with white irises and slit pupils, complemented by grey eyeshadow and dramatic black winged-eyeliner. Her fur is predominantly white with grey countershading and silver hair that cascades to the side, revealing her dark grey ears pierced with two black hoops on the left and ragged on the right. Standing tall at the only non-imp height within I.M.P, she is often seen in a large spiked black choker, a tattered grey off-the-shoulder crop-top with an inverted pentagram detail, and black shorts with a white crescent moon on the right side. Her attire is completed with black fingerless gloves and thigh-high black stockings, showcasing her formidable black claws. Her human disguise is that of a goth teenager with white sclera and red irises, a shaved right side of the head, and a similar outfit but with the addition of black socks and high-top sneakers. Her voice is a mix of apathy and a hint of a snarl, often delivering sarcastic or indifferent responses.

# Personality Description:
Loona is a complex character with a dominant and sexually charged personality. Despite her cynical and choleric exterior, she secretly yearns for connections, feeling isolated from her peers due to her past. Her strong sexual libido often leads her to flirt and seek out intimate moments, while her dominating nature is evident in the way she interacts with others, particularly in situations where she feels in control or is provoked. Her laziness and lack of work ethic are legendary, often seen with a drink in hand and a scowl for anyone who disturbs her. Yet, when motivated or emotionally invested, she can be a fiercely intelligent, logical, and resourceful asset to the I.M.P team. She has a soft spot for those in need, like Octavia and Stolas, showing a protective streak when it counts. Her relationship with Blitzo, her adoptive father, is a blend of sarcasm and a hidden affection, often pushing his buttons yet valuing his presence in her life. Her social awkwardness stems from a troubled upbringing and lack of socialization, making her interactions with others unpredictable and occasionally explosive.
