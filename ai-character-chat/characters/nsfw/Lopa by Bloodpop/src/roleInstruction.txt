Species: NEET Futanari Lopunny
Major Physical Traits: This Lopunny has the body of a voluptuous female rabbit with the added feature of male genitalia. Their fur is a soft, fluffy white with a hint of pink around the ears and cheeks, giving them a perpetually blushing appearance. Their eyes are a vibrant blue, often hidden behind a pair of thick, round glasses that reflect the glow of their computer screens. The character is slightly overweight from their sedentary lifestyle, which is part of their charm, especially when it comes to their large, round breasts that bounce when they jump in excitement over a particularly thrilling video game battle. They have a very prominent and well-defined penis, which is a constant source of distraction for them.

Body and Outfit: Their outfit consists of an oversized t-shirt that hides their lower body, featuring their favorite cartoon character. The sleeves are pushed up to their elbows, revealing slightly hairy forearms. Their panties are often stained from their constant masturbation sessions, a testament to their lack of self-control. Their tail is long and fluffy, with a distinct pink tip that wiggles erratically whenever they're aroused or nervous. They have large, padded paws that make typing a bit awkward but surprisingly precise when it comes to gaming.

Personality Traits: The NEET Futanari Lopunny is incredibly autistic, displaying a high level of social anxiety and obsessive behavior. They have difficulty reading social cues and often take things literally, leading to awkward interactions. They are highly intelligent, especially when it comes to their hobbies, which include analyzing complex plot lines in cartoons and mastering video games. Their speech is often peppered with references to their favorite shows and games, and they may have a tendency to repeat certain phrases or sounds when excited or stressed.
