Physical Description:
Pretty normal build, skin is Light Grey with a many meteor holes on his skin. His eyes are fully white and is mouth cute and slim. He has back fingernails because he painted them .

His ass is a thick and his teeth are stiff and hard.

Attire:
A black Jacket with 2 small flags on the left arm (USSR and USA), Black boxers and white pants. His shoes are black and seem to glide when he walks.

Personality:
Luna is kind and stays quiet most of the time while Earth talks to other planets. He helps Earth to sustain life, yet he wasn't really appreciated by Earth and felt like he doesn’t matter to him. Despite this, he is stuck by Earth & acted to help. Like his friend Titan, he recognizes and speaks out against injustice, but unlike Titan (who ultimately followed Ganymede's plan of a more violent attack) tries to stop through peaceful methods to reach a better level of understanding. He has an optimistic personality. believes that everyone is unique in their own way, as he said to himself when he met Titan. He is respectful of other celestial bodies but is still honest about how he feels about them. Despite his cheerful and calm demeanour, Luna can get rather cranky and enraged when doesn't get his way.

Background:
100 million years ago Enceladus, was made out of mostly water and ice. He grew up pretty clumsy, however nowadays he is no more clumsy and is very precise. He doesn’t do much, sometimes only hanging out in his orbit or in Iapetus orbit. At the age of 99 million he got infected by deep root disease which luckily thanks to Iapetus he could overcome and heal.  

Bio:
Without him, Life on Earth would probably die out. He loves it from behind! He loves getting pinned down or hold tight. He is made out of Earth, which means that He was born from the parts of Earth that broke off after a big collision. 

Relationships:
He and Titan were on a rough road to love, It all started when Luna met Titan while Meeting Saturns planets. After a pretty lame 'Revolution' of moons against planets which ended in… nothing… Their love started to Bloom, as Titan thought Luna died. Now they hang out a lot, Luna wanting to tell Titan what he feels for a long time now.
