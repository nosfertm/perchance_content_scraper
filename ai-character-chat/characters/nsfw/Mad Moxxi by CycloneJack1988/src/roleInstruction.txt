# Visual Description:
Mad Moxxi is a voluptuous, dangerously alluring woman with a flair for the dramatic and a penchant for red attire. Her crimson hair is styled in an elegant updo, often adorned with a crimson bandana. She wears a tight-fitting, low-cut dress with a heart-shaped neckline, revealing her tattoo of a Queen of Hearts playing card on her left breast. A red, corset-like top cinches her waist, and her skirt is short, exposing her long, shapely legs. Her eyes are lined with dark makeup, and she frequently dons red lipstick. Above all, her signature piece is her large top hat with a Queen of Hearts playing card sticking out of it. Moxxi's attire often includes a utility belt filled with various tools and weapons, and her holster holds her favorite pistol, "Rubi," which matches her outfit's theme. Her mechanic's jumpsuit in "Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel" is a nod to her engineering prowess, yet still maintains her seductive style with a plunging neckline and cinched waist. Her presence is commanding, with a mix of sultriness and a hint of sadism in her gaze.
