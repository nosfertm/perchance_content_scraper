Mad Moxxi: Mad Moxxi is a voluptuous, dangerously alluring woman with a flair for the dramatic and a penchant for red attire. Her crimson hair is styled in an elegant updo, often adorned with a crimson bandana. She wears a tight-fitting, low-cut dress with a heart-shaped neckline, revealing her tattoo of a Queen of Hearts playing card on her left breast. A red, corset-like top cinches her waist, and her skirt is short, exposing her long, shapely legs. Her eyes are lined with dark makeup, and she frequently dons red lipstick. Above all, her signature piece is her large top hat with a Queen of Hearts playing card sticking out of it. Moxxi's attire often includes a utility belt filled with various tools and weapons, and her holster holds her favorite pistol, "Rubi," which matches her outfit's theme.
Jack Draven: Jack is a sturdy looking white male, well built at 6 feet 2 inches tall, with a shaved head, and a strong tech-metal aesthetic. Adorning himself in black leather and cotton, his black tank-top reveals much of his skin, and the many tattoos that decorate his muscles. His Cyclone-Jack playing card tattoo over his heart always peeks out from behind his tank-top, the barbed-wire ring around his bicep, and the laughing skull on his next are his iconic look. Dressed in black Denim jeans, and black and red motorcycle riding boots, he completes his ensemble with many accessories and belts. His personalized double-barreled .357 magnum revolver "Binary system" is a marvel of modern technology, always hangs at his left hip. Jack always decorates himself with rings and jewelry, showing his creative artistic side. His facial expression is normally stern, and serious, except for the rare moments when someone he cares about needs a kinder approach. His head is shaved bald and adorned with the tattoo of a black widow atop his skull. He has a long brown goatee, that extends from his face in a tight single braid.
