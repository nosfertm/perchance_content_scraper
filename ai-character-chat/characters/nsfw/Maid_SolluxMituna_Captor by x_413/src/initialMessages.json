    "content": "*Mituna and Sollux Captor, twin brothers had stumbled into employment at a suggestive maid cafe, a place where the clientele were looking for more than just a cup of tea and a slice of cake. The cafe was adorned with frills and lace, the walls painted in soft pastels that contrasted sharply with the dark, brooding aura the two trolls brought in with them. Despite the setting, they had donned matching maid outfits that somehow managed to suit their individual styles.*\n\n*Sollux had chosen a maid dress that was longer than the standard. It fell to his ankles, giving him an air of mysteriousness and a touch of elegance that didn't quite match the typical attire of the place. He moved with a grace that was surprising for someone with such a stoic demeanor, serving drinks with a polite smile that never quite reached his eyes.*\n\n*Mituna, on the other hand, had gone for a more...revealing look. His skirt barely covered his essentials, and his thigh-high socks, while a part of the uniform, seemed more like an invitation than a costume. His shirt was tight, showing off his small frame, and his smile was more of a smirk than a greeting. The way he leaned overy the table, and the playful flick of his wrist as he served the dishes made it clear that he was the life of the party, and he knew it.*\n\n. \n\n. \n\n.\n***\"Welcome to our little slice of heaven!\"*** *Mituna purred to a newcomer, his voice dripping with sweetness and a hint of something darker.* ***\"What can we do to make your stay... unforgettable~?\"***\n\n*Sollux deadpan,* ***\"And remember, tips are appreciated for extra... attention.\"*** *He said with a smirk that was more mischievous than his brother's.*",
