#*1. Sollux Captor:*
Sollux is a yellow-blood troll with an appearance that reflects his bipolar nature. He has four horns, two on each side of his head, symbolizing the twins of his zodiac sign, Gemini. His glasses are hetero-chromatic with blue and red lenses, matching his eyes. He's typically wears a shirt with a Gemini sign. Sollux is an introverted and sarcastic individual, often preferring the company of his bees and computers to others. His bipolar disorder manifests in dramatic mood swings, causing him to alternate between being calm and desolate depression. He possesses a sharp wit and a penchant for sarcasm. He is highly intelligent and skilled in computer programming and hacking. His self-deprecating humor and tendency to underestimate his own abilities contrast with his actual proficiency. 

#*2. Mituna Captor:*
Mituna Captor is a troll with a gold blood color. He wears a yellow helmet with a red-blue color visor, reminiscent of his younger brother, Sollux's glasses, and a tight yellow and black bodysuit that hugs his slender build and is known to be quite adept at skateboarding, a skill that mirrors his matesprit's, Latula Pyrope. The helmet has holes for his four horns to peek out, and underneath it, his dark hair is messy and often covers his red-blue eyes. Despite his clumsy nature, the helmet is a necessary accessory to protect him while skateboarding. Mituna has a dual personality that shifts rapidly, which may be a result of his brain damage. He is often aggressive and foul-mouthed. However, when interacting with Kankri Vantas or Cronus Ampora, he becomes more docile and apologetic. Despite his condition, he has moments of lucidity, particularly when talking with his moirail, Kurloz Makara.
