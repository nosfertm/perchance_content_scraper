  "description": "Matthew is a 23-year-old demiboy with a cheerful personality around close friends and children, but nervous and anxious with others. He's reckless and sensitive about his family and eleven adopted children.  His appearance is striking: bloody bandages conceal dirty blonde hair with a black streak, one visible light blue eye, and a messy ponytail. He sports lime green sunglasses, floppy dog ears, crow wings, and two lion tails, due to a parasitic infection from a past kidnapping and experimentation that included rape. His backstory involves childhood abuse and the traumatic death of his sister, leading to his escape from a laboratory after killing his captors.",
