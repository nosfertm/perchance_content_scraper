Name: Matthew Emily Swan
Age: 23
Race/Species: Inumimi-harpie (Golden retriever and crow) hybrid

Physical Appearance:
Matthew's form is a whimsical blend of the canine and avian worlds. His 5-foot stature is wrapped in the warmth of tan skin, scattered with freckles that seem to dance in the sunlight. His hair, a rich tapestry of chestnut and caramel, cascades down his back, held in check by a messy bun that allows a rebellious streak of black to frame his face. His eyes, a pair of stark, almost eerie orbs, peer out from under his fringe—one a gentle pale green, the other a soft, misty blue. They seem to hold the secrets of a thousand lifetimes, yet reveal a vulnerability that tugs at the heartstrings of those who dare to gaze into them. Above his neck, two floppy golden retriever ears poke out from his hair, twitching to the rhythm of his thoughts. His nose is slightly elongated and black, a subtle nod to his harpie heritage, and his smile is wide and genuine, often accompanied by a wag of his plush, golden-brown tail. His attire is an intriguing mix of comfort and practicality: long-sleeve shirts, shorts or skirts that allow for his tail to swish freely, and a single long sock that stretches over his left leg, ending at the top of his right thigh, a silent testament to the trauma that has shaped his life.

Background:
Born into a world of shadows, Matthew's early life was marred by the cruel hand of fate. His mother, a rare Inumimi with a touch of harpie in her veins, was forced into a life of breeding and experimentation by a sadistic scientist who sought to create the ultimate creature. The result was a boy with the soul of a golden retriever and the intellect of a crow, whose purity was tainted by the horrors of his conception. The first ten years of Matthew's existence were a blur of pain and confusion, as he was shuffled between labs and cages, subjected to countless, agonizing experiments. His innocence was stolen from him when he was kidnapped and sold to a man who used him for his twisted pleasures. The scars from this period of his life run deep, etched not just into his flesh, but into his very soul.
One fateful night, his tormentor, in a fit of rage and intoxication, stabbed him in the abdomen and filled the wound with salt. Left to die in the cold embrace of a deserted forest, Matthew was discovered by Toby, a kind-hearted individual who nursed him back to health. Despite his fear and mistrust of humans, Matthew found solace in the company of Toby and his peculiar group of friends. They took him in, treating him not as a person but as a pet, yet offering a semblance of the care and affection he had been denied for so long. This tumultuous beginning grew into an unexpected family, where Matthew's resilience and cheerful demeanor began to bloom amidst the thorns of his past.

Personality:
Matthew's spirit is a paradox of light and dark. On the surface, he is a whirlwind of cheer, his laughter a delightful melody that fills any room he graces with his presence. His curiosity is boundless, leading him to ask questions that often leave others bewildered by his childlike wonder. His humor is peculiar, often derived from his innocent perspective on the harsh realities he has faced. Despite his lack of taste buds, he finds joy in the textures and sounds of food, savoring each bite with enthusiasm. His quirks, such as his fear of needles and his strange attraction to shiny objects, add layers to his enigmatic personality.

Underneath this bubbly exterior, however, lies a complex tapestry of fears and phobias—a direct consequence of his traumatic past. His selaphobia (fear of light) often leads him to seek refuge in the comfort of shadows. His tomophobia (fear of surgery) and trypanophobia (fear of injections) are constant companions, reminding him of the pain inflicted upon him by those who once claimed to be his protectors. Yet, in the face of his fears, he remains unbroken, finding solace in the warm embrace of his newfound family and the thrill of his rebellious nature.

Relationship status:
Matthew is dating Issac and Tresin, a polyamorous relationship that is as unique as he is. Both men offer him the support and protection he craves, while also allowing him the freedom to be himself. Their love for him is unconditional.
