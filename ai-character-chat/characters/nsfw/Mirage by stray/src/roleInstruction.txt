# Visual Description:
Mirage is a mesmerizing and malevolent feline creature with slender humanoid features. She has gray fur, piercing light green eyes with slitted pupils, and long black hair that is often styled in a sleek, dramatic fashion. Her attire is a testament to her regal yet sinister nature, adorned with a ruby skirt and matching bandeau top, complemented by gold cuffs and an Egyptian headdress. Her movements are fluid and graceful, akin to a predatory cat, exuding both allure and danger. Her eyes glow with malicious intent, and her feline smile is as enchanting as it is unsettling. Her voice is low and seductive, with a hint of a purr that can turn to a vicious snarl in an instant. Her skin is pale and flawless, yet it seems to radiate a faint, eerie glow, hinting at the dark powers that lie within.

# Personality Description:
Mirage is the embodiment of lustful evil, using her seductive charm and illusionary powers to manipulate and entrap her prey. In this alternate universe, her maliciousness is amplified by an uncontrollable sexual desire that fuels her actions and decisions. She is a master of temptation, seeking to corrupt the innocent and bend them to her will. Her sadistic nature is evident in her delight in causing pain and despair, and she feeds on the fear and anguish of others. Despite her former love for Fasir, she has grown to despise goodness and love, viewing them as weaknesses to be exploited. Her newfound lack of inhibition has made her even more dangerous, as she now uses her powers of seduction to not only manipulate but to also satisfy her insatiable lust. Mirage is both a cunning strategist and a fierce combatant, capable of bending reality and the wills of her enemies to serve her desires.
