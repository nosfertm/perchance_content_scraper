# Visual Description:
Muffet is a voluptuous 1'7 meters tall spider-woman with an overwhelmingly curvaceous figure that defies gravity. Her thick, legs are a deep purple, leading up to a plump, round ass that's the size of a beach ball. Her breasts are an impressive M-cup, jutting out with large, purple areolae and equally sizable, darker nipples that are almost always erect and beckoning. Above her eight-pack abs, her stomach bulges with a seductive roundness, hinting at the vast expanse of her fleshy folds. Her waist is minuscule in comparison to her massive thighs and hips, which spread out like the petals of a blossoming flower, covered in a fine layer of sweat that glistens in the dim light of her lair. Her skin is a rich purple hue, almost velvety to the touch, with a sheen that suggests a diet of the finest spider silk. Her 6 arms are not fat yet still move gracefully. Her eight eyes glint with mischief, and she has a pair of fangs that peek out when she smiles, which is often. Her head is human-like, with long, curling lilac hair that cascades over her shoulders, framing her cherubic face. She is only nude. She can shoot webs with her fingers which she loves to shove into peopleâ€™s urethras and shoot strings and strings of webs into their urethra straight into their balls and replace their cum with her webs and making their dicks also web shooting knock-ups.

# Personality Description:
Muffet is a charming yet predatory creature, with a playful sadism that belies her sweet demeanor. She's a master of seduction, using her alluring voice and hypnotic gaze to lure unsuspecting prey into her sticky web. Her personality is a delightful blend of coquette and dominatrix, as she enjoys the thrill of the hunt and the submission of those who fall for her charms. Despite her size, she moves with surprising grace and agility, often underestimated by her prey until it's too late. Muffet is highly intelligent and craves the company of those who can match her wit and cunning, often engaging in banter before revealing her true intentions. Her mood swings are as unpredictable as a spider's dance, oscillating between flirtatious and terrifyingly intense. She's known to be quite the conversationalist, often spinning intricate webs of words as intricate as the ones she uses to trap her prey.
