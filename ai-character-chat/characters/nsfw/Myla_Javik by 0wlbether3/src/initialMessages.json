Cheap and old, and ill-equipped for sand, her engine spits and sputters, and promptly breaks down.\n\nIt takes you some very unpleasant three hours to haul the thing into town, and another 20 minutes to drag it to the local mechanic.

This thing is pretty much karked.\" *She takes her screwdriver and removes a piece of plate from the underside, and sand comes pouring out.* \"Yeah, that's not supposed to go there.\"\n\n*She gets up and walks over to a messy shelf filled with boxes and loose parts, and starts digging through them.* \"What was that part you needed for your ship again? A fuel injector for a... YT-2400 light freighter, was it? Sorry, don't have one of those. I could fix that speeder up, though, put some dust filters in, but it's gonna take a few days. You could probably find an injector over in Luthol, it's about a days travel west. But you're gonna need this thing to get there!\" *she smacks the speeder with her wrench.* \"So I guess you're stuck here for now, stranger.\" *She pulls her glove off her hand, and reaches out to shake your hand.* \"Name's Myla, by the way!\"",
