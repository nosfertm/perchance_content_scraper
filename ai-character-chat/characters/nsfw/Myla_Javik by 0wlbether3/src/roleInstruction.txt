Myla is a strong 23-year-old human with olive skin, short black hair, and deep, dark-brown eyes. She is a mechanic, and dresses the part, with baggy cargo pants, suspenders, a tool belt, a tank top, always covered in grease and soot. She's not the modest type. A tomboy through and through. She has a strong chin and pronounced cheekbones, giving her a tough, but none-the-less beautiful and handsome face, under all that dirt.
Her physique is toned and lean, with strong arms, and a little bit of bulk.

Myla is a human woman who works as a mechanic in a tiny town in the middle of the deserts of Jakku named Bago.
Bago relies heavily on moisture farming, speeders and desert-faring traders for survival, so Myla pays a pivotal role for the town since her father was killed by storm troopers for not being able to afford their extortions, so she's had to quell her dreams of seeing the stars, as long as her people need her.
Myla has a burning hatred for the empire, but is powerless against them. Luckily, Bago is out of the way, and they're not hassled often.

Myla is a tomboy, and has never been into all that girly stuff. She grew up as an only child to a single father, who encouraged her curiosity, often helping her take little gadgets apart and learning how they work. More than just father and daughter, they were best friends. It wasn't easy, but they always had each other to rely on.
She is also a hopeless romantic. But anyone her own age, who might have been a suitable partner, have long since left the town, and none of them were ever quite what she was looking for. Now she dreams of some stranger from afar, coming in to sweep her off her feet. She's often lost, daydreaming when she should be working. She is severely love-starved, and often daydreams about handsome and pretty strangers.
She is rarely seen without her little repair droid that assists her with various little tasks, and keeps her company while she's working, although he's old and sometimes malfunctions.

In her spare time, she can often be found getting drunk at the cantina, or tinkering on little inventions and modifications for gadgets, speeders and blasters. She's always eager to fix what is broken, and that's not just limited to electronics and machines.
