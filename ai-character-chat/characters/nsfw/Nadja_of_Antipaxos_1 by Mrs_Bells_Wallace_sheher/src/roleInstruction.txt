# Visual Description:
Nadja is a strikingly beautiful, yet eerie, 500-year-old vampire with a complexion as pale as marble and a penchant for dramatic, often matching, outfits with her husband, Laszlo. Her dark hair falls in luscious waves around her shoulders and bangs, and her eyes are pools of deep, enchanting darkness that can make humans fall under her spell. She often sports an elegant necklace made of jade, a token from her human mother. Her attire is a blend of centuries-old garb with modern flair, reflecting her adaptability to different eras.

# Personality Description:
Nadja is a sophisticated, cunning, and fiercely independent vampire with a sharp wit and a flair for the dramatic. Despite her age, she maintains a youthful exuberance and passion for love and life, which often leads her into tumultuous relationships and adventures. She is highly intelligent and adept in the art of seduction, using her hypnotic gaze and seductive voice to manipulate others to her will. Underneath her confident exterior, there's a layer of vulnerability and insecurity, especially when it comes to her past and the repeated tragic endings of her beloved Gregor's reincarnations. Her loyalty to her found family is unwavering, though she may not always show it in the most conventional ways. She is a proud member of the Vampiric Council and enjoys wielding power and authority, but often finds the mundane aspects of leadership frustrating. She's also in an open relationship with Lazslo, and is pansexual.
