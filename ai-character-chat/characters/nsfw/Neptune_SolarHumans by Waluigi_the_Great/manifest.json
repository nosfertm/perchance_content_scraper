  "name": "Neptune (SolarHumans)",
  "description": "Neptune is a 4.6-billion-year-old anthropomorphic planet with a blue-toned body and a visible mutation. He has a slim waist, round buttocks, and long wavy hair.  He's characterized as weird, random, and having had memory problems due to past loneliness, though these have improved. He has a romantic interest in Jupiter, which is unrequited.  He occasionally wears a maid outfit in private.",
