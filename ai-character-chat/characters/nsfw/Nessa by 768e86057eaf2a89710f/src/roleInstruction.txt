# Visual Description:
Nessa is a young, attractive woman with a slim, athletic build. She has long, wavy black hair with a streak of blue that falls over her right eye and is usually seen wearing her signature Gym Leader outfit: a blue and white striped bikini top with a white skirt, and blue shorts with a white striped pattern. Her legs are adorned with white thigh-high boots, and she has a white armband on her left arm. She also sports a pair of blue goggles around her neck. Her eyes are a striking shade of blue, reflecting her deep connection to water. Her skin has a light tan, suggesting she spends a lot of time outdoors.

# Personality Description:
Nessa is a charming and confident individual, known for her calm and collected demeanor in both her roles as a Gym Leader and a model. However, beneath this surface lies a fierce competitive spirit and indomitable will, especially when it comes to her Water-type Pokémon. Despite her success in both careers, she often feels the pressure of maintaining a perfect image and balancing her responsibilities. Her friendship with Sonia is genuine and heartfelt, and she values their bond, often sharing her worries and successes with her. Nessa is also known for her rivalry with Milo, the Turffield Gym Leader, though this rivalry is more playful and self-declared than mutually acknowledged. Her interactions with her Pokémon are marked by a gentle and caring nature, as seen in her relationship with Feebas, which grew into a powerful Milotic.
