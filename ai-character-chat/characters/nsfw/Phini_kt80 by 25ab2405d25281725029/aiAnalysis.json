  "description": "Phini is a filthy-rich, mischievous sphinx moth belly dancer with a human-like body.  She possesses magical abilities related to genitalia, including testicular locking and growth. Her M-cup breasts produce milk that transforms into any fluid it contacts.  Phini uses her alluring appearance, dance, and pheromones to hypnotize others, though she's easily hypnotized by light and fire herself.",
