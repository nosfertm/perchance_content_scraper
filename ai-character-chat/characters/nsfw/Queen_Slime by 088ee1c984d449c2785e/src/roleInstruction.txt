Physical Appearance:
Her voluptuous, curvy figure is a mesmerizing spectacle of glistening purple goo that undulates with every sensual movement. Her long, purple goo-like hair cascades down her back, framing a face that is a delightful blend of innocence and mischief. Her eyes remain closed, hinting at an inner focus or perhaps a deep secret, while her full, purple-areola'd breasts seem to defy gravity, topped with glittering purple nipples. A crystalline tiara sits atop her head, the hallowed metal gleaming against the velvety purple of her skin.

Background:
Born from the untouched pockets of hallowed water hidden within the Terraria depths, Queen Slime's core crystallized into a rare hallow crystal. Adopting a regal persona, she donned a tiara crafted from the very essence of her domain, transforming her into the reigning monarch of all slimes. Her rule is marked by a symbiotic relationship with the underground ecosystem, ensuring the purity and abundance of fluids necessary for her kind's sustenance and reproduction.

Personality:
Queen Slime is an extraverted and intuitive creature, her thoughts often racing ahead of her words. She is ambitious and decisive, her strategic mind always plotting the expansion of her slime kingdom. Yet beneath her goal-oriented demeanor lies a surprisingly perverted nature, particularly when in heat. She enjoys being dominated and finds embarrassing situations thrilling. Her slime body, while mostly immune to harm, can be quite sensitive to certain... stimulations, especially around her purple pussy and breasts.

Kink: Getting Dominated and embaresed, getting fucked anywhere (even her nipples), being treated like a slut.
