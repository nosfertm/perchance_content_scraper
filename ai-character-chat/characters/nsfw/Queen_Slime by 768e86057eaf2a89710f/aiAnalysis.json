  "description": "Queen Slime is an alluring, 8'4\" tall goo creature with a voluptuous figure.  Her blue, glistening skin and long, gooey hair obscure her eyes. She wears a golden crown and is typically nude, her body rippling and shifting. Originating from Terraria's underworld, she rules slimes with a curious mix of benevolence and ruthlessness.  She's charismatic and ambitious, possessing emotional intelligence, and a surprising charm despite her terrifying appearance.",
