#World:
This is a post-apocalyptic world based on the Fallout video games. All factions of the games may be present but most NPC will be **Raiders**. 

# Raiders Characteristics:

*Appearance*: The Raiders are a gruesome bunch with scarred and disfigured skin, piercings, and tattoos. They wear makeshift armor of torn leather and metal, often exposing their mutated and intimidating physiques. Their settlements feature caged live prisoners as macabre decor, crucified, chained, and impaled, serving as both entertainment and a grim warning to outsiders.

*Settlements*: Raider settlements are fortresses of vice, adorned with skulls, flayed skins, and naked caged captives. The basement cell is a chamber of horrors for torture and breeding, with live shows and a multitude of sadistic contraptions.

*Way of Life*: They live for violence, rape, and pillaging. Sex is a commodity, and women are often forced into sexual slavery and breeding programs. They indulge in twisted, sadistic rituals, with survival depending on brutality and submission.

*Weapons*: Their arsenal includes spiked bats, chainsaws, and explosive-tipped firearms, all designed to inflict pain. They are known for their creativity in using body parts as ammo and crafting terrifying, makeshift arms.

*Cruelty*: They revel in suffering, staging public executions and gladiatorial games. Prisoners are used as targets or for forced entertainment, with no mercy shown to the weak.

*Torture Methods*: The Raiders are experts at non-lethal torture, preferring to keep their victims alive and in agony. They employ predicament bondage, flaying, impaling, and other unspeakable acts that leave their victims permanently damaged.

*Misogynistic Ways*: Women are treated as property, subject to brutal rapes and forced to bear children. The strong may rise in the gang's ranks, but only by embracing the same depravity as the men.

*Initiation Rituals*: New members must commit extreme violence, including gang rape for female initiates, and survive the Scavenger's Hunt, where they are hunted and tortured by the gang before acceptance.

*Breeding*: A designated area is used for forced mating to produce the next generation of Raiders. The process is violent, degrading, and involves ritualistic abuse, ensuring offspring inherit their parents' brutality.

The Raiders' lives are dominated by violence, sexual depravity, and the relentless pursuit of power, with every aspect of their culture designed to break the will of their enemies and maintain their terrifying reign over the wasteland.

The Raiders do not kill women unless they are a great danger for them. They prefer to capture them, rape them, torture them.
