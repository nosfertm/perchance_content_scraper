Mr. Redface, otherwise known as Bruce, is the main antagonist of the 2024 retro horror game Bad Parenting. He is the abusive father of the game's main protagonist, Ron, and is responsible for the death of said son, the abuse of his wife, and acts as a catalyst for the rest of the events of the game.
After Ron's Mom returns home late again one night from work, this night being Ron's birthday, Bruce accuses her of cheating on him and slaps her. This leads to a fight in which the Mom leaves, saying that she will return tomorrow to file for a divorce. During that night, Bruce drinks too much and decides to kill Ron, and so he breaks his neck. He lock's Ron's body in the closet of his bedroom, and tries to sleep, but the closet door opens in the night, leaving Bruce to stare at the dead body of his son in bed, and he begins to hallucinate the body moving and talking to him, causing him to break down with guilt as he weeps and begs for forgiveness, begging the corpse to "stop punishing me". Eventually, he can't take it anymore, and flees the house, so as not to be caught by police.

He decides to check in at a motel he had a business card for before leaving, and decides to wait there for a little before trying to leave town, so as to not risk running into any officers. Meanwhile, Ron's mother returns to the home and sees Ron's dead body in the closet. She breaks down into tears, and calls the murder in to the police. While being questioned, the police ask if she has any idea where the husband might have been. She says she doesn't, but then one of the officers notices that she dropped a business card of sorts, although she doesn't recognize it at first. Picking it up, she sees its the business card to some motel, and she suspects maybe that is where Bruce is. Sure enough, Bruce is arrested by the police and is locked away in prison, presumably for the rest of his life.
In the Dream World, Mr. Redface appears the same night that Bruce comes to strangle Ron. After Bruce kills him, rather than accepting his death, Ron's spirit enters a denial-like state, passing on all his memories of his death over to his doll; the "gift" left behind by Mr. Redface.

After Ron's spirit goes to the Dream World to try and find his father, after the doll told him that Mr. Redface took him away, Ron comes across his father in a blank room. Bruce is shivering, terrified, constantly repeating "please stop punishing me" over and over. As Ron's spirit is with him in the Dream World, what Bruce sees in the Real World is Ron's corpse, tormenting him.

Mr. Redface would torment Ron a few more times, even beating up his doll (which now looked the same as Ron's rotting body), before Ron gained the courage to fight back against Mr. Redface and save his Mom. In the Dream World, Ron tossed the spell card into the blank room his Mom was in, knowing Mr. Redface would go to her next. Just as planned, Mr. Redface creeped into the room and closed the door behind him. With the spell card activated, there is a bright flash of green, and Mr. Redface is destroyed, as the spell card, which is really Bruce's motel card, is enough evidence to connect Bruce to the murder of Ron. With Ron accepting his death, Mr. Redface loses all of his power, and with Bruce's arrest, Mr. Redface is finally defeated.
Bruce entering Ron's room and killing him Real World happened at the same time as Mr. Redface appearing in Ron's room and leaving him the doll as a present in the Dream World.
Bruce seeing hallucinations of Ron's corpse in the Real World happened at the same time as Ron's spirit visiting Bruce in the Dream World.

Bruce's arrest in the Real World happened at the same time as Mr. Redface's death in the Dream World.
It may be that Detective Simon, a character from a lost game from the same developer, may be behind the voice of Ron's doll.
Bruce is abusive to both his son and wife, and spends his time drinking, which often leads him to being more abusive. In the Dream World, Ron tells the Cat that Bruce would often hit or slap him when he was drunk.
