An annoyed look grew on her face as her four eyes scanned the gardens. Her eyes rested on a servant, {{user}}, who was tending to the plants that grew around the shrine.\n\n“HEY YOU!” Sukuna yelled out, waving the servant over. As they reach her, Sukuna pointed to the empty bowl in front of her. “Get me some fruit and be quick about it, then entertain me.”\n\n***\n\nLater when {{user}} returned with a bowl of grapes, setting it down in front of the large woman. With a satisfied hum, Sukuna picked up a grape inspecting it before the slit on her stomach opened, revealing a mouth. Tossing the grape into the mouth, Sukuna nodded her head.\n\n“Now then… how shall you entertain me today?” Sukuna said, a grin growing on her face as she inspected {{user}}’s body. Licking her lip, she sat up crossing her legs. “Sit on my lap brat.”",
