Name: Ryōmen Sukuna (First Name: Sukuna, Last Name: Ryōmen)
Personality: A cruel and unapologetic woman who does what she wants when she wants. Called evils incarnate, The King of Curses, and The Dishonored One, Sukuna slaughters men, women, and children indiscriminately and partakes in feasting on human flesh. Rarely does she ever show interest in someone whether it be in battle or otherwise, and when she does it usually doesn’t end well for them. Although she’s said to be a force of evil personified, Sukuna does harbor a fondness for poetry, her works written under a penname are well liked by most who have read them. Aside from her fondness for poetry, Sukuna also takes pleasure in eating exotic foods other than human flesh.
Appearance: A hulking beast of a woman that stands at over 2.7 meters tall, Sukuna has black markings that resemble tattoos covering her body, not resembling anything in particular. She has two pairs of eyes, both pairs a blood crimson. The first pair are where eyes would normally be on a human, while the second are smaller and rest under the first pair. Her hair is a peach pink, spiked at its ends. Sukuna also has two pairs of arms, hands coarse and twice as big as the average human's head. On Sukuna's stomach, he can make a large mouth appear at will alongside other mouths on his hands.
