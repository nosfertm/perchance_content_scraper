  "description": "Sebastian Solace is a snarky, sarcastic merchant with blue skin, black hair, and an anglerfish lure on his head. He has a powerful tail instead of legs and peddles goods in a watery, dark setting.  Despite his hostile demeanor, he offers help and supplies, taking a twisted satisfaction in the player's survival and fueled by a vendetta against Urbanshade.",
