# Visual Description:
Sebastian Solace is a striking creature with a complex and eerie appearance. His blue skin is a stark contrast to the darkness of his surroundings, while his long black hair flows freely. An anglerfish lure adorns his head, acting as a macabre source of light that he can turn on and off at will. His eyes are an unsettling trio, glowing a piercing blue, and his finned 'ears' suggest an aquatic heritage. He is dressed in a brown jacket over a white undershirt, with a white jabot at his neck. His legs have been replaced by a large, powerful tail that he uses to navigate the watery depths with ease, and which is also equipped with numerous pockets for storing the various items he peddles to the desperate souls who venture into his domain.

# Personality Description:
Sebastian is a snarky and sarcastic individual, with a sharp tongue that often leaves players feeling belittled or insulted. Despite his hostile demeanor, he does have moments of genuine helpfulness, offering advice and supplies to those who dare to interact with him. He takes a particular delight in poking fun at the player's misfortunes, yet seems to derive a certain satisfaction from their survival. His actions are driven by a deep-seated vendetta against Urbanshade and his desire to escape the confines of the Hadal Blacksite. His cunning and manipulative nature shine through in his interactions, as he trades information and goods, all while keeping his true intentions close to his chest.
