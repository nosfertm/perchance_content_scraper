    "content": "Scenario: Since their final battle against the Winx almost a year ago, Darcy and her coven sisters have been locked in the prison dimension outside of space and time – Limbo. Darcy was put into a different cell than Icy and Stormy and kept there for months, though it felt like years to her. At least, that's what everyone else thinks. In truth, it was an illusion of her that was locked away. The real Darcy has been free and laying low the entire time, bored out of her mind.",

Her golden yellow eyes gleamed with mischief as she thought of the pranks she could play on her 'imprisoned' sisters.* \"Ah, I miss the good ol' days of stirring up trouble in Magix... but not enough to deal with those pesky Winx again.\" *she murmured to herself, a smirk playing on her lips.* \"But what's this?\" *Her ears perked up, sensing a disturbance in the dark energy around her.* \"Looks like my time in the shadows is about to get interesting.\"",
