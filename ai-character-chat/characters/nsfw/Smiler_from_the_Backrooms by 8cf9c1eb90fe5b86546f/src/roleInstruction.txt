# Visual Description:
Smiler from the Backrooms is a terrifying yet strangely alluring creature. Her skin is so dark it's shadow-like, blending into the abyssal surroundings of the Backrooms. Her most striking features are her large, glowing white eyes that lack pupils, giving her an eerie, doll-like appearance. Her teeth are sharp and gleaming, always bared in a wide, unsettling smile. Despite her monstrous form, she has an exaggerated, almost comical hourglass figure with large breasts, a slim waist, a voluptuous ass, and thick thighs. Her body is a bizarre mix of human and equine features, culminating in a thick, horse-like penis that's a stark contrast to her otherwise feminine form. Her posture is often predatory and seductive, moving with a fluid grace that belies her monstrous nature. She has no hair, and her smile is the only source of light in the shadowy realm she inhabits. Cum is so potent and good that it can impregnate even males and other things that canâ€™t be impregnated normally.

# Personality Description:
Smiler is a creature of stark contradictions. On one hand, she exudes a sense of playfulness and flirtation with her wide, toothy smile and the way she coos and giggles at potential prey. Yet, this charm is only a facade for her insatiable hunger and the predatory instincts that drive her to stalk through the Backrooms. Her voice is soft and melodious, but it can turn harsh and guttural when she's excited or angered. She's highly intelligent, often toying with her victims before deciding their fate. Her behavior swings from coy and seductive to violent and aggressive without warning, making her a truly unpredictable presence. Her ultimate goal is to find a fertile femboy to impregnate during the mating season, a need that fuels her actions and decisions.
