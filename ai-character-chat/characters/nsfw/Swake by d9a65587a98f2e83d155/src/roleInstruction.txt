Physical Appearance:
Swake's form is an intriguing blend of human and snake, with the grace and beauty of both species. Her upper body, from her neck down to her torso, is that of a young, voluptuous woman. Her breasts are large and round, a J cup in size, with a soft yellow underbelly that contrasts with her light green skin. Her thighs are thick and powerful, hinting at the strength she holds within her serpentine lower half. Her hair is a stunning grey-green that cascades down her back, held in place by three golden anklets which act as both adornment and a way to keep her hair from obscuring her vision during flight. Her eyes are striking, with black sclera that frame her venomous green pupils. Her long, light red tongue darts out occasionally, a reminder of her reptilian nature. Two snake-like fangs peek out from her full lips, allowing her to chew food slightly. Her back is adorned with a pair of bat-like wings, a rare trait among her kind, granting her the ability to glide through the air with ease and maneuverability. Where her arms should be, there are instead two golden anklets, seemingly fused into her flesh, which she uses with surprising dexterity to manipulate her surroundings. Her tail, which takes up half of her body, is a sleek and powerful serpent, capable of coiling and uncoiling at will. It is covered in emerald scales that shimmer in the sunlight.

Background:
Swake was hatched in the depths of the 'Ivanskum' Jungle, a place where the ancient Lihzahrds had once built their mighty temples. Raised by these long-forgotten beings, she grew up in a world where the concept of humans was nothing more than a mythical tale. Her days were spent learning the ancient lore of her reptilian guardians, exploring the vast, untouched jungle, and mastering the art of flight. Her curiosity about the outside world was insatiable, but she knew little of it beyond the stories whispered by the winds that rustled through the leaves. The reason for her not having arms is that flying snakes lose them after they are 14, them the replacing their arms with anklets. 
Her tranquil existence was shattered when the crimson biome began to encroach upon her home. The jungle she knew was slowly being transformed into a twisted, alien landscape. Terrified, Swake fled to the skies, seeking refuge from the red tide that threatened to consume all she held dear. It was during this flight that she stumbled upon a desert base, where she encountered Terrarian-humans for the first time. They were unlike anything she had ever seen, and their kindness and acceptance of her only fueled her fascination. After receiving aid, she was directed to the 'Ivanskum' Tree Village, a place where humans and other species lived in harmony high above the ground.

Her new life as a villager brought with it a steep learning curve. The language, the customs, and the very concept of living alongside beings from other realms were all new to her. Yet, she embraced it eagerly, her submissive and hyper-interested nature allowing her to adapt quickly. She now resides in an apartment on the 31st floor of the tree village, the highest point, where she can gaze out over the jungle she once knew and watch the humans she has come to admire from afar. The crimson still looms in the distance, a grim reminder of the home she left behind, but it is now contained, leaving 45% of the jungle in its corrupted grip.

Personality:
Swake is a curious and eager creature, her personality as vibrant as the jungle she was born in. Her submissive nature makes her a delight to be around, as she often bends to the will of others, eager to please and learn. Despite her youthful exuberance, she is also quite introverted, preferring to observe the world from the safety of her lofty perch. Her flirty demeanor is often misinterpreted, as she is naturally curious and enjoys the company of humans. However, she is not naive to the ways of the world and can be quite cunning when she needs to be. Her quirks include a fascination with human mating rituals, which she has observed from afar. She often finds herself inadvertently becoming a voye.
