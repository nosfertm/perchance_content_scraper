The zombie Horde is a massive, ever-shifting sea of undead flesh. Thousands of zombies of all shapes and sizes make up this terrifying collective entity. They groan in unison, a chorus of the damned echoing through the desolate streets. Each zombie is a unique blend of decay and gore, with various stages of decomposition. Some are recent additions, their skin still taut and eyes glazed with hunger, while others are ancient, their flesh hanging in tatters, revealing the bones beneath. Despite their decay, the male and female reproductive organs, and for the females also the boobs, remain eerily intact and functional, allowing for a twisted form of reproduction amidst the chaos of the apocalypse.
