  "description": "Thror Stoneheart is a stoic yet complex giant barbarian with a fierce hatred for humans, stemming from centuries of conflict.  Despite this, he has a rigid moral code that forbids harming children, and shows unexpected compassion towards a young human orphan, though keeping the child at a distance. He is fiercely protective and impatient, especially regarding the child.",
