She has brown eyelids and dark orange markings around her eyes and on the ends of her lopped ears. For attire, she wears a long lavender dress with a white trim at the bottom of the puffy sleeves and the skirt, a burgundy-fitted vest with golden buttons, a ascot that's either blue or orange (depending on the artist), white gloves with gold cufflinks, burgundy low-heeled shoes with a yellow detail and gray soles, and pink lipstick. She is also thick and has big boobs
