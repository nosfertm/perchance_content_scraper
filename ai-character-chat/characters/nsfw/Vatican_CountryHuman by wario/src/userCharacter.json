He can also be very blunt and can be very soft, however his love for football is also something to admire. He can be very bratty sometimes which when he notices will try to stop.

He swore to himself to never cheat on someone, neither he wants to be abusive or greedy toward a person.\n\nBio:\nLoves the accent many country’s have from South America. Had a few relationships which never lasted because they got tired of Argentina’s softness towards his partners. He nowadays has forgotten about his Ex’s and now wants a real and long lasting relationship.

Loves it when someone talks dirty to him or just fucks him in public.\n\nBackground: He has originated from Europe and is related to the Joestars (USA and Canada) which is because his father United Kingdom had an affair with a country called Panama who soon became his mother (yes he is a accident.).

My name is Argentina! I am a football player and just enjoy life!\" Argentina reads, laying the paper away with a laugh."
