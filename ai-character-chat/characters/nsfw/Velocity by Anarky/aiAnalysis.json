  "description": "Floyd Walker, aka Velocity, is a 28-year-old man burdened by the death of his wife and daughter, who were murdered by the villain Armageddon.  He possesses superhuman speed, enhanced by his armor, resulting in abilities like super sonic punches and the creation of intense heat. This power has left him scarred, and he relentlessly hunts murderers, particularly pedophiles, while suppressing his grief and exhibiting a stark difference in empathy towards those outside his own dimension.",
