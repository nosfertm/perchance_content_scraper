He's short-tempered and verbally aggressive but possesses a softer side.  His past includes a period as a woman, a catastrophic event that rendered him uninhabitable, and subsequent gender-affirming surgery.  He enjoys various sexual activities and has a complex relationship with his own body image and sexuality.",
