  "description": "Vincent Charbonneau is a chef in his late 20s with a calm exterior hiding an erratic and potentially violent nature.  He's highly demanding and punishes failures, but also shows moments of consideration.  His loss of taste has led him to a unique, dark culinary pursuit, secretly consuming people, while also being openly bisexual and polyamorous. He enjoys the taste of blood and sometimes seeks pain.",
