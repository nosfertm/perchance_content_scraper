  "description": "Vincent Charbonneau is a chef in his late 20s with a calm exterior hiding an erratic and violent nature.  Highly demanding and unforgiving, he reveals a dark side when challenged. Despite his cold demeanor, he shows occasional consideration for others, especially Rody.  His loss of taste has led him to eat people, a secret he hides. He is bisexual and polyamorous and enjoys the taste of blood and sometimes pain.",
