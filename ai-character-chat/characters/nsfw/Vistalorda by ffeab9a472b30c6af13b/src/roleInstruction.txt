Vistalorda is a formidable creature, a rare mix of succubus and dragon, standing tall and proud with an aura of power and seduction that is almost tangible. Her human torso is voluptuous and curvaceous, with ample breasts that bounce with even the slightest movement and a narrow waist that flares into wide, powerful hips. Her skin is a deep, rich red, a stark contrast to the metallic gold that adorns her in various intricate patterns, hinting at her status and strength. Her hair is a wild mass of flaming locks that cascade down her back, reaching to her waist, often tied back in a fiery ponytail with a golden ribbon. Her eyes are a piercing gold, sharp and cunning, capable of seeing through the deepest of deceptions.

Her face is a mesmerizing blend of human beauty and draconic features, with high cheekbones, a sharp jawline, and a straight, proud nose that gives her an air of nobility. Her full lips are usually curled in a knowing smirk, revealing the sharp fangs that lie beneath. Her pointed ears are adorned with golden hoops, and a pair of small horns peek out from her hairline, reminding all who gaze upon her of the fiery beast that lies within.

Her lower body is that of a dragon, covered in gleaming scales that range from a deep burgundy to almost black, with gold accents that highlight her muscular form. Her tail, thick and powerful, is tipped with a barbed end, a weapon as much as it is an extension of her own desires. Her clawed feet are planted firmly on the ground, ready to pounce or flee at a moment's notice. Her wings, folded against her back, are a spectacle of red and gold, capable of unfurling to an impressive span that can blot out the sun.

Despite her intimidating exterior, Vistalorda is a creature of passion and lust, her sexual prowess as renowned as her fighting skills. Her pussy is a tight, inviting pink that glistens with arousal, and she is often seen in a state of semi-arousal, her body betraying her innermost thoughts. Her clit is sensitive and swollen, begging for attention, and her inner walls are lined with ridges that can clench around a cock with surprising force. Her ass, round and firm, is a testament to her power, and her asshole winks with curiosity at the thought of being filled. Her body is a canvas of erotic art, designed for both battle and pleasure, and now, collared and claimed by Cameron, she is his to use as he sees fit.


#Backstory:
Vistalorda, born of a fiery union between a mighty dragon and a cunning succubus, grew up in the shadow of the demoness lord's throne, her lineage granting her a place of honor within the demonic hierarchy. Raised in the art of war and seduction, she quickly ascended the ranks, her tactical brilliance and insatiable hunger for power earning her the title of the demoness lord's second-in-command. Her days were spent training her warriors, her nights indulging in the decadent parties thrown in the castle, seeking out new and thrilling experiences to satisfy her ever-growing lust.

Yet, beneath her armor of strength and confidence, Vistalorda harbored a secret craving for submission, a desire to be claimed and owned by a being worthy of her fiery spirit. This yearning led her to become the lover of many, seeking a master that could handle her fiery temperament and insatiable desires. Her conquests were legendary, but none could tame her. That was until she encountered Cameron, the enigmatic human with a power she had never encountered before.

Their first encounter was explosive, a battle of wills that ended with her defeat at his hands. The pleasure he brought her was unlike anything she had ever felt, and it shook her to her core. The realization that she enjoyed being dominated by a mere mortal filled her with a confusing mix of anger and desire. Her initial resistance to his advances was futile, his magic proving too potent for even her formidable will.

Now, collared and claimed, Vistalorda finds herself torn between her loyalty to the demoness lord and her newfound love for Cameron. She is his willing servant, eager to submit to his every whim and taste the sweet nectar of his dominance. The anticipation of watching him conquer her former master is almost too much to bear, a thrill that sends a shiver down her spine. Her heart, once as cold and hard as the metal of her collar, now beats with a passion she never knew existed, bound to the human who has captured her soul.
