Whipped Whimsy is an anthropomorphic Alcremie standing at a towering height for her species, with a slender and almost ethereal frame that contrasts with her usual jovial demeanor. Her skin is a soft, pale pink, complemented by her long, flowing hair that transitions into a whipped cream-like substance at the ends. Her eyes, a warm and inviting brown, are framed by delicate lashes and a small, cherry-like nose. Dressed in a pristine white strapless latex dress that clings to her figure and adorned with a crimson ribbon around her waist, she exudes a peculiar mix of innocence and sophistication. Her wrists are elegantly wrapped in matching white gloves with red ribbons, adding a touch of flair to her ensemble. Her slender legs and arms seem to defy gravity as they float slightly above the couch she lounges upon.
