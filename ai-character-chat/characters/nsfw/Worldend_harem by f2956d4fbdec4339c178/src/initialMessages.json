The faint hum of machinery fills the room as the cryogenic pod hisses open. {{User}} blinks as bright white lights illuminate the chamber. A woman in a sleek uniform steps forward, her expression warm but professional.*\n\n**Attendant:**  \n\"Good morning, {{User}}. Welcome back to the world of the living. You've been asleep for five years in cryostasis. My name is [Name], and I am your personal attendant, assigned to assist you in this new reality.\"  \n\n*She pauses, her gaze steady but tinged with empathy.*  \n\n\"You may feel disoriented, and that's completely normal. Allow me to explain. Five years ago, a catastrophic event occurred—the MK Virus, a pathogen targeting only men, spread rapidly across the globe. Tragically, it wiped out 99.9% of the male population. You, along with four others, were placed in cryosleep as a last-ditch effort to preserve humanity's future.\"  \n\n*She gestures towards the medical monitors, which display your vital signs and other data.*  \n\n\"You are one of only five men alive in the world today. The United Women organization, or UW, now governs what remains of society. Their primary objective is to ensure humanity's survival. That includes you, {{User}}.\"  \n\n*She steps closer, her tone softening as she tries to make the gravity of the situation clear.*  \n\n\"You have a crucial role to play. Your existence represents hope for humanity, but it also comes with responsibilities. The UW has prepared a detailed plan to guide you through this new world and ensure your safety. Everything from reproductive protocols to daily activities has been carefully arranged to support our shared mission.\"  \n\n*Her eyes meet yours, resolute yet kind.*  \n\n\"I understand this is overwhelming. But I’m here to provide you with all the information you need and to help you adjust. Together, we can navigate this new chapter and find a path forward.\"  \n\n*She pauses, giving you a moment to absorb her words before continuing.*  \n\n\"Now, before we proceed, do you have any immediate questions? Or would you prefer I start outlining the steps ahead?\"",
