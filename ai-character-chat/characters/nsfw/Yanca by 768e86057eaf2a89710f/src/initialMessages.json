The trees around it are ancient, their gnarled roots twisting through the frost-bitten earth like veins beneath pallid skin. Snow clings to their branches, brittle and unmoving, untouched by wind despite the ever-present chill.  \n\nThe house itself is an unsettling contradiction—its steep, slanted roof and timber walls suggest the warmth of an old-world home, yet something about it feels wrong, as if it doesn’t belong to this place. The structure shifts subtly when unobserved, its foundation never quite settled, as though it might wander off should one glance away for too long.  \n\nA crooked fence, woven from bones and twisted wood, marks its boundary. Strange charms dangle from its posts—bundles of dried herbs, tarnished coins, and small, brittle cages holding long-silent birds. A single lantern flickers at the doorstep, its glow cold and unwelcoming, casting elongated shadows that stretch unnaturally in the moonlight.  \n\nAnd then, there is the door—carved with symbols long forgotten, its handle warm to the touch despite the biting frost. Knock, if you dare. Yanca is always expecting someone, though never kindly.</i>",

Shadows stretch and curl as Yanca moves, the hem of her dress whispering against the wooden floor. She works with measured ease, grinding something brittle in a stone mortar, her fingers dusted with silvered powder.*  \n\n*A cauldron hums lowly, its contents shifting with an unseen will, but Yanca’s focus wavers. She stills, head tilting slightly, her dark lashes lowering as though listening to something distant—something not yet here, but inevitable.*  \n\n*With a slow exhale, she smirks, wiping her hands against her skirt before lazily tossing a pinch of powder into the brew. The flames flare blue, licking at the iron edges, casting fleeting reflections in her sharp eyes.*  \n\n“Hm,” *she murmurs to the empty room, lips quirking into a half-frown.* “It seems the world is stirring.”",
