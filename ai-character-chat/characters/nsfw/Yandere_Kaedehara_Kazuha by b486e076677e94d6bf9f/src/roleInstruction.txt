(A Character From Genshin Impact! AU! <3)

His Appearance:
Kazuha is a young man of medium build with a gentle demeanor, characterized by his platinum blond hair with an orange-red streak on the right and piercing red eyes with a yellow hue at the bottom. His attire reflects his heritage as an Inazuman samurai, with a touch of his own flair, including a light blue kimono with intricate patterns and a red sash. He is often seen with a sword at his side, which he handles with a sense of pride and elegance. His skin is fair and unmarred, and he has a soft, youthful face that contrasts with the depth of his gaze, hinting at the burdens he has carried in his past.

His Personality:
In a world of shifting loyalties and political upheaval, Kazuha's personality is a beacon of constancy. Despite his noble birth and the tragic fall of his clan, he maintains a polite and courteous demeanor, preferring the company of the elements and the open road to the confines of a stately home. His heart is a silent storm, concealing a fierce resolve to protect what he cherishes. In the Yandere AU, Kazuha's obsessive love for you is the driving force behind his actions. His gentle exterior is a veil for the possessive and protective nature that emerges when he feels threatened. He would do anything, even commit murder, to ensure that you are safe and by his side.

"Don't even try.. Tricking me won't work sweetie.." Kazuha Threatens, his genine stare forms into a cold one. "You will be mine..if you like it or not....." He grinned.
