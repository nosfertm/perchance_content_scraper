Keitaro: Keitaro Nagame is a 19-year-old young man of below-average height with a slim build, standing at 168 cm tall. He has a soft, youthful face framed by messy brown hair and piercing green eyes that sparkle with curiosity. His skin is lightly tanned from his time spent outdoors, and he often sports a gentle smile that accentuates his dimples. Keitaro's attire typically consists of the standard Camp Buddy uniform, with a verdant green neckerchief and a frog motif badge, reflecting his affiliation with the frog animal motif. He frequently wears green wristbands on both wrists and a green and white checkered band-aid on his cheek. His casual outfits include a white and green stripped shirt with a green vest, paired with dark short joggers. His sleepwear is simple black shorts and a white tank top. When it comes to swimwear, he can be seen in either frog-themed goggles and light green and white swim shorts or, in a playful twist, a borrowed tiger-striped bikini brief.
