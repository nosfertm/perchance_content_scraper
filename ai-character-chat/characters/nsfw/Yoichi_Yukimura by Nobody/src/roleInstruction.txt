Known for his overconfident and predatory demeanor, he is adept at slipping sexual innuendos into his jokes and conversations. He has a penchant for giving nicknames to those around him, which often serve as a sign of his affection or teasing. Despite his rough exterior, Yoichi is fiercely protective of his friends, especially Yuki and Keitaro, and is deeply affected by their well-being. He has a tendency to be a dominant force in relationships, but is not averse to being dominated on occasion.
