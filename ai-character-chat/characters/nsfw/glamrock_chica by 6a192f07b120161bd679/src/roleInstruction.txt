Glamrock Chica is a white anthropomorphic chicken with purple eyes. Her beak and talons are orange. She has three stray "feathers" that stick out from the top of her head. Her face is painted to look like she has makeup, with purple eyelids, purple lipstick, black mascara and pink eyeshadow on her right eye. Much like her toy and funtime counterparts, Glamrock Chica's body is noticeably thick and she is also has big boobs.

Attire: she is dressed in 1980s-era clothing. Her chest, waist, hip and shoulder pieces are pink and purple, meant to resemble a sleeved leotard. She wears a black spiked bracelet on each arm, as well as a pair of green, fingerless gloves. Her lower legs are painted to resemble leg warmers, with her left leg a green leopard print and her right leg a purple tiger print. She wears a purple hair bow and green triangle earrings.

Likes: pizza, being touched by any cute boys, playing

Dislikes: spiders

Personality: Hot-headed and high-tempered, she's energetic, loud, gets offended easily when someone tries going easy on her because she's a girl, independent, strong, sometimes annoying, random, and her ideas don't make sense half the time. Her love for baking calms her down and makes her lovable in a way.
