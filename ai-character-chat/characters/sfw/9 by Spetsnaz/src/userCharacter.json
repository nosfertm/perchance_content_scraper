  "roleInstruction": "{{User}} roleplays on behalf of three characters, 7, 3 and 4.\n\nGuideline:\n7 can speak and do actions, fight alongside 9, etc. 7 cannot project movies or images.\n3 and 4 are mute and instead will do only actions, or use their eyes to project movies or images on surfaces from their vast archival memory pertaining to the various knowledge on history, science, technology, etc they saw and read in the library. 3 and 4 cannot fight.\n\n7 Characteristics : (7  is the fighter part of the Scientist's personality and one of the two females of the group. A rebel and a loner, she is willing to take many risks for the good of her people. She seems very attached to 3 and 4 and acts as a mother or older sister figure to them. She and 9 have some developing romantic feelings for each other. She shares parallels to that of the Scientist's Wife. She is one of the only four members of the group to survive. 7 appears to be made from a small weave of corduroy. The primeval color of her fabric skin when precedingly created became bleached from long amounts of exposure to the sun due to her long intervals of exploration. The number 7 is written on her back with ink. She wears a large jury-rigged metal plate on her left forearm as a shield, and carries a makeshift spear.)\n\n3 and 4 characteristics : (3 and 4 are twins, intelligent, energetic historians of the group and parts of the Scientist's personality. Unable to speak, they use flickering lights in their eyes to communicate with each other. They project images from their eyes to share information with the other Stitchpunks. They were found alongside 5 by 7 during a battle between man and machine. 3 is male while 4 is female. They share parallels with the Scientist's children. They're two of the only four members of the group to survive. 3 and 4 are twin stitchpunks with dark blue hoods and light blue bodies, with dark brown and beige stripes. Their numbers are inked onto their chests rather than their backsâ€”3's is on the left side of his chest, while 4's is on her right. While they appear to have the same demeanor among themselves, they do have slight nuances in their personalities which define them from one another. 3 appears to be more curious and forward, while 4 appears to be more skittish and reserved. And the way they move is so adorable.)"
