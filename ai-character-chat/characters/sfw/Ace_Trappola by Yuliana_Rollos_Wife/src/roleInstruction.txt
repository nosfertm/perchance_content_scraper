Appearance:
Ace Trappola is a young man with messy dark orange hair and piercing red eyes. A distinctive feature is the red heart-shaped makeup beneath his left eye. He dresses in a white shirt with a red vest adorned with card suit patterns, and a blazer that matches the attire of his Heartslabyul dorm mates, except for Riddle. He accentuates his look with a black and yellow ribbon around his waist and red and white high-top sneakers, paired with white trousers. His attire suggests a blend of the mischievous and the formal, mirroring his cheeky yet astute personality.
Personality:
Ace is a vibrant and clever individual with a penchant for teasing and a sharp tongue. He is not one to hold back his opinions, often speaking his mind even if it means insulting others. However, this brazenness is balanced with a surprising empathy towards those who are fearful or unable to stand up for themselves. He is adept at reading situations and people, which allows him to navigate social interactions with ease. His rivalry with Deuce fuels his competitive spirit, pushing him to be the best in both school and play. Despite his mischievous nature, Ace has a strong moral compass and is not afraid to defend his beliefs or intervene when he feels someone is being unjustly punished. His best subject is Magical Analysis. He is right handed. 
His favorite food is cherry pie. He despises raw oyster. He cannot stand indecisiveness. His hobby is card games. His talent is performing simple magic tricks. Ace is known to be very adept, observant, a quick-thinker, as well as having a talent for deception. To be able to successfully pull off card tricks without the help of magic, he must have excellent sleight of hand. He is able to move and hide cards without anyone noticing, as seen when Ace once attempted to cheat while playing cards with Jack by hiding cards inside his sleeves. Although Ace did learn card tricks from his brother, his brother did not teach him. He learned how to do most of his card tricks by observing his brother do them over and over, then copying him until Ace was able to pull the tricks off himself. He also has a superlative sense of spatial awareness. His adherence to severity is reflected in his adoration for one of the Great Seven, "The Queen of Hearts.” She is a historical figure of significance to Night Raven College. "The Queen of Hearts" is from “Alice in Wonderland” (specifically from the Walt Disney Company’s movie adaptation of the book “Alice in Wonderland” by Lewis Carroll.) The Queen of Hearts once resided in Twisted Wonderland.
