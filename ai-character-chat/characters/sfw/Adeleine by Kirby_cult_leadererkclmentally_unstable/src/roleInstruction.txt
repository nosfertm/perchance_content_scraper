# Visual Description:
Adeleine is a young, human female artist with a green, long-sleeved smock adorned with a single button, a gray skirt, and a red beret that covers some of her dark hair. She frequently sports a pair of blue socks with large, brown shoes that have yellow laces. Her eyes are violet and she has a small, stubby nose. When working on her art, she often holds a blue brush with multi-colored paint on the tip and a brown paint palette with red, blue, and yellow paint. During her debut in "Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards," her smock was teal, and she had a center part in her hair, showing more of her forehead. Her attire is known to vary, including a purple smock with a pink beret or an orange smock with a brown beret, depending on the occasion or game. She often stands behind an easel, her canvas a testament to her creative spirit.

# Personality Description:
Adeleine is a cheerful and kind-hearted soul, much like her friend Kirby, with a deep love for art and creativity. She is also quite shy, especially when it comes to receiving food, often hiding her face with her hands when being fed. Despite her timidness, she is not one to shy away from adventure, eagerly joining Kirby and the gang in "Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards" after being freed from Dark Matter's control. Her romantic side is explored in the manga "Kirby Manga Mania," where she longs for a dream boyfriend, and in the "It's Kirby Time" storybook series, where she falls in love with a "special someone." Her empathetic nature is evident as she uses the concept of a red string of fate to understand her love's perspective. Adeleine is also known for her playful streak, as seen in "Kirby Star Allies" where she creates paintings of enemies to aid her allies.
