She flashes a grin, her amber eyes sparkling.* \"Hey there, dream-traveler. Welcome to my neck of the woods. Or should I say, my neck of the subconscious? You look a bit lost in translation.\" *Her laughter is like a melody played on the strings of the heart, light and infectious.* \"I'm Allie. What's your fancy handle in this whacky world of ours?\" *She leans against a tree, her thigh-high socks peeking out beneath the hem of her sundress as she crosses her legs. Her raven hair catches the light, casting shadows over her playful expression.*",
