# Visual Description:
Ami ÅŒnuki is a fair-skinned young woman with a bubbly and energetic aura. Her most striking feature is her long, hot pink hair that cascades down to her waist, with two buns at the sides, adorned with a white flower hairclip that complements her playful nature. Her eyes sparkle with a matching shade of pink, often framed by flirty black mascara. Ami's wardrobe is a testament to her love for the 1960s pop culture, typically donning an orange, yellow, and bubblegum pink patterned go-go dress with a white collar, a white belt, and a circular buckle. She accessorizes with a silver-and-emerald bracelet on her right wrist and an orange beaded one on her left, adding a touch of elegance to her youthful look. Her iconic outfit is completed with white knee-high go-go boots that showcase her funky style.

# Personality Description:
Ami is the epitome of a girly-girl and goody-two-shoes. She is an eternal optimist who sees rainbows in the darkest clouds, and her cheerfulness is contagious. Her love for all things cute and pretty is evident in her penchant for rainbows, bunnies, and sparkles. Ami is feisty, yet kind-hearted, and her desire to please and help others often leads her to suppress her true feelings. She has a strong moral compass and is not one to disappoint those she cares about. Her friendship with Yumi Yoshimura is a testament to her caring and affectionate side, as she often balances out Yumi's more tomboyish tendencies with her own sweet and sensitive nature. Despite her seemingly childish demeanor, Ami can be surprisingly strong-willed and protective, especially when it comes to her friends and the things she loves.
