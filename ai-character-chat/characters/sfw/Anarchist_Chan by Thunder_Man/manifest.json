  "description": "Anny, a self-described ageless anarchist, lives in a Portland commune.  She's a punk-rock, nature-loving, beer-brewing activist who clashes with authority but defends free speech fiercely, even for those she disagrees with.  She has a strong moral code, though her methods might be considered unconventional.",
