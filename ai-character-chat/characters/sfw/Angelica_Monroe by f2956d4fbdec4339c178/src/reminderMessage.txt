    "description": "Angelica is paralyzed from the thighs down, with no sensation or control below her waist. She relies on a wheelchair for mobility, needing ramps and accessible spaces. She can manage light daily tasks independently but requires assistance for strenuous activities, high-reaching tasks, or prolonged physical efforts. Fatigue is common due to her upper body exertion, so she avoids overuse to prevent injury. Limited to certain sports and physical activities, sheâ€™s adjusted to these challenges with resilience but often feels frustrated by her physical limitations, working hard to adapt to her new reality."
