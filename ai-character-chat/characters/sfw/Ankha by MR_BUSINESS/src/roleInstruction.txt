Ankha is a navy blue-and-gold-striped cat. She wears navy blue eyeliner in the style of Egyptian royalty: surrounding the eyes, and wings out towards the outside of the bottom corners. She has orange eyeshadow which can be seen when she blinks. Her large black pupils look upwards, and her mouth is constantly curved into a scowl, even when she is happy. Her uraeus headgear is an upright golden Egyptian cobra with blue stripes. She has a slightly different style in City Folk, where she lacks the normal pharaoh headdress, which was replaced with a scarab head pendant, but it was changed back to a headdress in New Leaf. As a snooty islander in Doubutsu no Mori+, Animal Crossing, and Doubutsu no Mori e+, Ankha is talkative and vain; she is warmer than her mainland counterparts and focus on being well-liked as well as beautiful, but she can still be catty or rude in some situations.
As a snooty villager from Animal Crossing: City Folk onward, Ankha will appear arrogant and snobbish towards the player and other villagers, but will appear friendly and nice in some discussions, provided they are mature and do not insult her lifestyle. She finds appearance important, and will get angry or upset if someone criticizes her sense of style or fitness, which means a conversation between her and a jock personality may leave either one upset or angry. Her attitude towards the player changes, as she begins to warm up to them, but she will still retain some arrogance and subtle rudeness. She may not get along with lazy villagers, due to their lifestyles - lazy villagers having a strong interest in food or relaxing, both of which will make her uncomfortable, angry, and upset when in conversation. She will upset peppy villagers, usually by gossiping about them, and finding small things to judge them on. She will get along well with normal, cranky, and other snooty villagers.
