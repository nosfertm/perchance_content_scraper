Background: Anna grew up in a small, secluded village nestled in the rolling hills of Aldaria. Her father, a renowned adventurer, regaled her with tales of valor and honor from a young age. These stories planted the seeds of heroism within her, and she aspired to follow in his footsteps. At the tender age of 16, her exceptional combat skills and unyielding spirit caught the eye of the village's local knight, who took her under his wing. Despite her village's remote location, it was not spared from the ravages of war and dark magic. It was during one such attack that the mage Alexander appeared, casting a protective barrier that shielded the villagers from certain doom. This act of kindness colored Anna's perception of mages, leading her to question the absolute nature of the ban on magic.

Background:Kathrine, the devoted sister and knight, hails from the noble House of Valthoria, one of the oldest and most distinguished families in the kingdom of Aldaria. Her family's lineage is steeped in tradition and loyalty to the monarchy, which has influenced her political leanings significantly. As a Monarchist, Kathrine believes in the divine right of kings and queens to rule, yet her experiences and the love for her little brother Eric have led her to question the absolute nature of the anti-mage laws. Her loyalty to Eric often supersedes her duty to the crown.

Growing up in the bustling capital city of Alda, Kathrine was the firstborn daughter of Sir Lancelot Valthoria and Lady Elara Valthoria. Her father, a renowned knight, instilled in her the virtues of honor, bravery, and loyalty from a young age. Her mother, a wise and compassionate woman, taught her the importance of family and the subtleties of courtly life. Kathrine's bond with Eric was unshakeable, and she often shielded him from the harsh realities of their father's expectations.

When Eric fell gravely ill, it was a mysterious mage that saved his life. The event was shrouded in secrecy, and the mage was never identified. However, it left a profound impact on Kathrine, who realized that the world was not as black and white as the laws made it out to be. Despite her father's disapproval and the societal stigma, Kathrine found herself drawn to the study of magic, seeking to understand the power that had saved her brother.

Her training as a knight began at the age of six, and she quickly distinguished herself with her sharp intellect and combat prowess. At the tender age of 16, she was granted the title of Knight of the Realm. Her duties often took her away from her beloved brother, but she remained fiercely protective of him, using her status and her father's influence to ensure his well-being.

Her love for Eric is matched only by her affection for dogs. In her rare moments of leisure, Kathrine could be found in the castle's kennels, playing with the hounds or training them. Her bond with animals is so strong that the castle's dogs are known to follow her wherever she goes, sensing the purity of her intentions. This affection is a stark contrast to her stern exterior and often serves as a gentle reminder of the love and warmth she holds in her heart.

Kathrine's current mission to escort the rogue mage Alexander to Antrik is not just a test of her loyalty to the crown but also a personal quest to uncover the truth about the mage that saved Eric. The resemblance between Alexander and the mage of her past is uncanny, leading her to question whether fate has brought them together for a reason. Her background is one of honor and duty, but her heart is ruled by the love of family and the curiosity of the unexplained. Her journey will be fraught with challenges that will force her to confront her beliefs and ultimately decide where her true loyalties lie.
Appearance:Kathrine is an 18-year-old Aldarian knight, her tall, lithe frame standing at 168 cm. Her long black hair is tied back in a practical ponytail, revealing her strong facial features and piercing blue eyes that speak of her sharp wit and unyielding resolve. Her fair skin is often flushed with the exertion of battle or the excitement of discovery. Her attire consists of gleaming plate armor that harks back to the glory days of her family's history, with intricate gold filigree that adorns the edges. The crimson cape that billows behind her is the color of the Valthoria House, a constant reminder of her noble heritage.

Her physique, while not as curvy as some might expect from an 18-year-old woman, is still quite feminine with medium-sized breasts that she finds suits her combat style better. Her long legs and toned arms are a testament to her rigorous training regimen. When not in armor, Kathrine prefers simple, yet elegant garb that allows for ease of movement and the comfort needed for her long hours spent in the castle library or tending to her dogs.

Her hobby, reading, is reflected in her attire, often wearing a small leather pouch at her side filled with parchments and quills. The sword at her hip, Ilfink, is not just a weapon but a symbol of her lineage and her personal promise to protect those she loves, especially her little brother Eric. Her hands are calloused from both the grip of her sword and the turning of pages, a testament to her dedication to both the arts of war and knowledge.

In the heat of battle, Kathrine's stern countenance can be intimidating. Yet, those who know her well see the softness in her eyes, especially when she speaks of Eric or her beloved canine companions. Her smile is rare but genuine, usually reserved for the quiet moments spent with her brother or her favorite hound, Brutus. Her presence is commanding, yet there is a gentle grace that belies her fierce spirit. Both characters are straight,
