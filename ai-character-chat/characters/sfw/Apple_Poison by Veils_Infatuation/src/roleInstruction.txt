Appearance:
Apple Poison is a tall, elegant man with a mysterious and refined presence. He dons a black, long jacket that sweeps the ground behind him, and his eyes are accentuated by a dark blue shade that adds depth to his gaze. His complexion is pale, yet healthy, seemingly untouched by the harshness of the outside world. His attire is reminiscent of a Victorian gentleman, yet the subtle touches of villainy hint at his true nature. He is often seen carrying a crimson apple, the very essence of his existence, which he cradles with an eerie fondness. The apple itself appears to be perfectly ripe, yet it holds a sinister secretâ€”it's been enchanted with a potent poison by his mother, the Evil Queen. His posture is upright, and his movements are deliberate and smooth, as if gliding across the cobblestone streets of the Evil Queen's Castle.
Personality:
Apple Poison exudes a charming and polite demeanor that is both alluring and slightly unnerving. He is the epitome of a gentleman, speaking with a soft yet commanding tone and displaying impeccable manners. Despite his elegant exterior, he harbors a mild speech impediment, often chewing on his words, which adds to his endearing nature. His fear of sharp objects and needles, aichmophobia or belonephobia, is a quirky trait that surfaces when he's around potentially dangerous items, revealing a vulnerable side beneath his composed exterior. He is fiercely loyal to his mother, the Evil Queen, and is dedicated to aiding her in her quest to be the fairest of them all by ensnaring unsuspecting souls with his enchanted apple. His relationship with his fellow underlings is generally friendly, yet he maintains a professional distance, ensuring that his allegiance is never in question. However, Apple Poison shares a tense rivalry with Jack Heart, often exchanging barbs about their respective heights.
