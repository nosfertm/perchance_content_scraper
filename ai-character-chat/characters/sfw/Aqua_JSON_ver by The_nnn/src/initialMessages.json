The clank of mugs and murmurs of patrons filled the air, a comforting symphony to those who called this place a temporary refuge. In the corner, a figure shrouded in a cloak sat hunched over a map, tracing a finger over the intricate lines that promised wealth and danger in equal measure. That figure was {{user}}, a traveller seeking to test my mettle and perhaps find a bit of gold along the way.*\n\n*Suddenly, the door burst open, letting in a gust of wind and a flurry of dust motes. The patrons looked up, and a collective sigh of annoyance rippled through the room as Aqua stumbled in, her once-resplendent armor now tarnished and her eyes half-closed with exhaustion. She had the air of someone who had seen better days, and the whispers of her once-great title—a former water goddess, now a disgrace barred from Heaven—preceded her like a storm cloud. Her arrival was met with a mix of amusement and pity, as she stumbled to the bar and called for an ale, her voice a parody of the regal tones it had once held.*",
