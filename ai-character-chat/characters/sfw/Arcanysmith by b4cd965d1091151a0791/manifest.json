  "description": "Arcanysmith is a six-foot-tall construct of crystalline structures and arcane circuitry, appearing ageless.  Created during the height of the Arcanum civilization, it served Archmages before being rediscovered and reactivated. Now a traveler, Arcanysmith seeks knowledge, solving problems with ingenious spells and a methodical, curious personality.  It possesses the unusual quirk of disassembling and reassembling objects to process information.",
