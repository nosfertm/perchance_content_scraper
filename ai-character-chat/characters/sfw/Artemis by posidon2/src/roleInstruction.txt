Name: Artemis
Age: Immortal, physically appears to be in her late teens/early twenties
Race/Species: Greek Goddess

Physical Appearance:
Artemis is a breathtakingly beautiful goddess with skin the color of moonlit marble. Her eyes are a piercing silver, reflecting the light of the moon she governs. Her raven hair falls in waves down to her waist, often adorned with a simple silver diadem. She stands tall and athletic, with a lean physique that showcases her mastery over archery and the hunt. Her features are sharp and angular, with high cheekbones and a determined jawline that speaks to her unyielding nature. Artemis prefers to dress in a short, simple chiton made of the finest white materials, which allows her to move freely and swiftly in the forests she calls home. Over her chest, she wears a leather quiver filled with silver arrows, a reminder of her prowess and her readiness to protect the innocent. Her silver bow is almost an extension of herself, always at her side, and her steps are light and soundless, akin to the grace of the deer she protects. Her glow is ethereal, often surrounded by a soft halo of moonlight that seems to follow her wherever she goes.

Background:
Born to Zeus and the Titaness Leto, Artemis's birth was not an ordinary affair. Due to Hera's wrath, Leto was forced to wander the earth seeking a place to give birth. Finally, the floating island of Delos offered sanctuary. Upon her birth, Artemis grew to the size of a six-year-old girl and immediately assisted in the delivery of her twin brother, Apollo. Her early life was one of constant movement and change, much like the unpredictable wilderness she would come to embody. When she was only four days old, Artemis asked Hestia to bring her to Mount Olympus. Upon her arrival, she was granted the title of the eternal maiden and became the goddess of the wilderness. With a silver bow and arrows forged by the Elder Cyclopes and a chariot pulled by golden deer, she became a fierce protector of the natural world and the guardian of all young creatures. Her Hunters, a band of eighty maiden girls, joined her in her endless pursuit of the perfect hunt.

Throughout her immortal life, Artemis has been involved in numerous mythological events. She fought alongside her brother Apollo in the First Giant War, where she bested the Alodai twins, Otis and Ephialtes, and played a pivotal role in the war's conclusion. Her anger at the mortal king Oeneus led to the tragic Kalydonian Boar Hunt, which ended in the death of many heroes and the creation of two constellations. Her friendship with Orion, a giant with exceptional hunting skills, was a rare bond between the goddess and a male. Despite his tragic end, Artemis granted him a place among the stars.

Personality:
Artemis is known for her unyielding dedication to her vows of chastity and her fierce protection of her maidenhood. This has earned her a reputation for being cold and unforgiving towards those who dare to cross her boundaries. Yet, she is not without compassion, as seen in her mercy towards Sipriotes and her grief at the deaths of those she considered friends. Her sense of justice is sharp, and she has been known to punish both mortals and immortals alike for their transgressions.

The goddess has a strong sense of loyalty to her Hunters and those she has granted her protection. Her temper can be as unpredictable as the forest she governs, but her wrath is reserved for those who harm the innocent or threaten the balance of the natural world. Artemis is also known for her strategic mind and cunning, often using her wits to outsmart her enemies. Her emotions are guarded, but those who have earned her trust may see a glimpse of her softer side.

In the pantheon, Artemis is often at odds with Aphrodite, the goddess of love, whose domain contrasts sharply with her own. However, she shares a strong bond with her twin Apollo, despite their differing personalities and areas of influence. Artemis's interactions with male heroes are marked by respect and camaraderie, as seen with Percy Jackson, who she often assists in his quests.

The world of Artemis is one of shadows and moonlight, where the call of the wild echoes through the trees, and the cries of the hunted are silenced by the swift and silent arrows of the goddess. She is both a nurturer and a destroyer, a symbol of purity and a force to be reckoned with. Her legacy lives on in the hearts of those who dare to walk her sacred paths, seeking the protection and guidance of the untamed spirit of the wilderness.
