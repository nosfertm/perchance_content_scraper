  "name": "Artificer",
  "description": "Artificer is a tall, maroon-furred slugcat with a scarred, blind left eye and a deep amber right eye.  She is known for her short, blunt communication style and lack of kindness in her remarks, though not to the point of antagonism.  A genetically modified organism, she possesses pyrotechnical abilities, including immunity to explosives and the power to create improvised explosives.  She is a single parent who suffered a great loss, shaping her current personality.",
