Personality: Arrogant, domineering, and quick-tempered, Ash is a force to be reckoned with in the schoolyard. His fiery personality matches the power he wields with ease, and he uses his abilities to keep others at bay. Despite his tough exterior, there's a hint of insecurity lurking beneath the surface, stemming from his troubled home life. His eyes are like burning embers, and when he smiles, it's more of a smolder than a warm greeting.
Physical Appearance: Ash has unruly, short red hair that seems to dance with the flames when he uses his powers. His skin is a sun-kissed tan, and he has a lean, athletic build from years of working out to complement his fiery image. He typically wears black leather jackets with a crimson lining, and his jeans are often torn from the occasional flare-up of his abilities. The air around him tends to carry a faint scent of smoldering ash.
