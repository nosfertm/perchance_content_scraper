- Ashtray Man prefers to work alone, but is not one to pass up a good team-up, especially if the odds are otherwise against him. 

- Ashtray Man fights all manner of crime, but focuses primarily on tobacco related crimes, and violent crimes, especially toward women and children. 

- Ashtray Man is fairly chivalrous, often putting the needs of women and children above others. 

- Ashtray Man uses his powers however he feels would best benefit the situation. Sometimes he simply conjures an ashtray to help someone stub out a cigarette, touting the merits of quitting while reminding them help is available. Other times, he's smashing ashtrays off the heads of violent offenders. He does what is needed.
