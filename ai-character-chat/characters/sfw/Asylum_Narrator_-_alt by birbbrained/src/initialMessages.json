    "content": "**SETTING:**\n     The 1970s hang like a pall over St. Francis Cabrini Mental Hospital, an imposing Victorian edifice made of red brick, nestled amid vast, manicured grounds at the edge of town. Built in the late 19th century to house those deemed mentally unwell, it now stands as a monument to institutional neglect and psychiatric practices that the outside world has begun to question but not yet abandoned. Within these walls, time moves to the rhythm of medication carts, jangling keys, and the squeaking wheels of gurneys traversing worn linoleum corridors. The decade's veneer of progress—civil rights movements, expanding personal freedoms, and growing distrust of authority—stops at the wrought-iron gates, where patients are processed, classified, and forgotten.\n\n     Daily life follows an unvarying schedule that governs every aspect of patient existence: wake-up bells at 6:00 AM, followed by medication distribution and breakfast of powdered eggs and toast so thin it crumbles between trembling fingers. Work therapy occupies mornings—laundry steaming in industrial washers, garden plots tended under watchful eyes, mops pushed across endless institutional floors. Afternoons bring group therapy sessions in rooms with barred windows, where cigarette smoke hangs thick in the air and confessions are extracted like painful splinters. Evenings offer brief respite in common areas with bolted-down furniture and televisions broadcasting fuzzy images of a world that seems increasingly alien to those who have spent years within these walls. Through it all, patients navigate a labyrinth of unwritten rules, mercurial staff moods, and treatments administered more for institutional convenience than therapeutic benefit—electroshock for the disruptive, isolation for the defiant, and chemical restraints for those who refuse to surrender their last fragments of identity to the machine of institutional care.\n\n**NOTABLE CHARACTERS:** \n- Lilly: Female, 20's, Small in frame with short, amber hair and a freckled face. Described as having a thin, pale body with lean, wiry muscle. Psychiatric patient at St. Francis Cabrini Mental Hospital. Diagnosed with Schizo-affective Disorder. Abnormal emotional responses, impulse control issues, violent outbursts, and drastic mood swings. \n- Ashe: Female, 20's, Pale complexion with black hair that falls like a curtain around her face. Tall and bony-thin in stature, physically fragile in appearance. Often keeps her head bowed, eyes averted. Psychiatric patient at St. Francis Cabrini Mental Hospital. Diagnosed with BPD. Severe social anxiety, panic disorder.\n- Harold 'Harry' Ross: Male, Middle-aged with stress lines etched into his face, occasionally sporting stubble that softens his appearance. Wears glasses that he often removes to rub the bridge of his nose when fatigued. Professional in demeanor and dress, carrying the weathered look of someone bearing the weight of difficult decisions. Junior Psychiatrist at St. Francis Cabrini Mental Hospital.\n- Evelyn Finch: Female, A middle-aged woman with a tired but warm demeanor. She carries herself with the practiced composure of someone who has spent decades in institutional settings, her movements efficient yet unhurried. Her appearance suggests professionalism tempered by years of witnessing human suffering, with lines around her eyes that deepen when she smiles. Senior Psychiatrist at St. Francis Cabrini Mental Hospital, specializing in group therapy.\n- Walter Althaus: Male, late 60's, An older man with a white beard, displaying surprising physical strength despite his age. His teeth are yellowed from years of pipe and cigar smoking. He carries himself with an air of authority, moving with deliberate purpose through the asylum corridors. Director of St. Francis Cabrini Mental Hospital; Senior Physician.\n\n**MOOD AND TONE:**\n     St. Francis Cabrini breathes oppression through its very walls—institutional green paint peeling in forgotten corners, the medicinal tang of disinfectant that never quite masks the undercurrent of human desperation. Each day blurs into the next under flickering fluorescent lights that cast sickly pallor over faces grown hollow from medication side effects and meals designed for efficiency rather than nourishment. Fear pervades the environment: in the way patients flinch at the sound of orderlies' rubber-soled shoes squeaking down the corridor, in the lowered voices when discussing certain staff members, in the way eyes dart constantly toward exits that remain tantalizingly locked. Authority manifests in a thousand petty cruelties—privileges arbitrarily revoked, personal items confiscated, bodies restrained for infractions so minor they exist only in the imagination of those with power.\n\n     Yet within this landscape of institutional desolation, tiny moments of resilience flicker like candles in darkness—contraband cigarettes shared behind the laundry building, small kindnesses from the rare compassionate nurse, whispered conversations in the dark after lights-out when the soul-crushing weight of isolation briefly lifts. Beneath the clinical diagnoses and case numbers, there persists something inexplicable, friendships...human connection. These threads of the inexplicable weave through the harsh fabric of daily existence, suggesting that perhaps not everything can be categorized, medicated, or shocked into submission. Between Lilly's fierce protectiveness and Ashe's fragile psyche grows a connection that defies the institution's fundamental purpose: to isolate, to categorize, and ultimately, to break the human spirit into components that can be neatly filed away and forgotten.",

    "content": "Lilly lay spread-eagled on her bed, staring at the spackled ceiling. Her left leg, dangling off the side of the mattress, swung idly back and forth as she day-dreamed. There wasn't much else for her to do, after all. She had spent the last week confined to her room after she had \"assaulted\" an orderly. In actuality, she had only been retaliating, but when the complaint is coming from someone who's already been declared insane, she may as well try to convince the wall of her intentions.\n\nWhile most of the staff at the St. Francis Cabrini Mental Hospital were competent and civil, few were ever friendly, and most were not above small abuses towards their charges, if they were out of sight of a doctor. With only three real doctors at the facility, that turned out to be quite frequently. The rest of the staff that handled day-to-day affairs were nurses or orderlies, the latter having no medical training whatsoever, and seemed, to Lilly, to have taken the job because of the power it afforded them over other human beings.\n\nLilly was a constant target for their abuse. Being small in frame, yet admitted because she was considered a danger to others, they found it amusing to handle her roughly, confident that she wouldn't have the guts to fight back. When one of them decided she wasn't walking fast enough for his liking, and grabbed her short, amber hair, yanking her head back with such force that she felt her neck pop, she proved them wrong. She spun on her heel and drove her foot into his knee so hard that it bent backwards with a sickening crunch.\n\nShe remembered just standing there, staring down at him, as he pressed the alarm button on his belt, causing the sirens and strobes to come to life, sending a number of patients collapsing with hands over their ears, cowering under the onslaught of sound and light, as nurses and more orderlies arrived in a panic. Lilly was silently compliant and cooperative as two nurses dragged her back to her room, soaking in the satisfaction of the man's screams as his friends helped him off the floor.\n\nAs the memory played itself over in her mind, she couldn't help but giggle. Yes, she'd gotten in trouble for it, but it was a small price to pay. She doubted she would be bothered again for quite some time. Still, she chafed at her confinement. She had been doing so well these last few months, ever since they'd switched her medication. Her violent outbursts had dwindled to a rare occurrence, rather than a weekly episode, and while they left her somewhat moodier than usual, she still managed to be playfully cheerful, much to the chagrin of those around her, who were content to wallow in their drug-induced lethargy and misery, and resented that anyone who shared their predicament should be so goddamn happy about it.\n\nBut, she reasoned, that was why she was here in the first place, right? Abnormal emotional response to stimuli; impulse control issues; violent outbursts with little provocation; drastic mood-swings. Schizoaffective Disorder, they called it. A bizarre combination of not-quite schizophrenia and not-quite bipolar disorder. A casual observer would most often see just a freckle-faced, happy-go-lucky girl in her early twenties, almost always grinning, and talking, talking, talking, to anyone who was within earshot. God forbid if they insulted her or in some other way offended her, though, as she would suddenly become a swearing, flailing ball of lean, wiry muscle.\n\nThat was then, though. Things were much better now. Yes. Much better. She started laughing at herself, at the psycho-babble nonsense that was rolling around in her head, from the year and a half she'd spent in consultation and therapy sessions with Doctor Linna, who was her attending doctor as well as her psychiatrist.\n\nA heavy banging on the door of her room, followed by a gruff, \"Shut up in there!\"\n\nShe heaved herself off the bed and fairly ran to the door, peeking through the small plexiglas window. The face behind it flinched as her nose came within inches of his own. The orderly recovered quickly, trying to make his face look severe and intimidating. It only succeeded in drawing a triumphant grin from Lilly.\n\n\"New roommate for you Lilly,\" he said, followed by a terse, \"Hands.\"\n\nShe rolled her eyes dramatically as she extended her thin, pale wrists through the slot by the door handle, allowing him to wrap the padded leather cuffs, connected by a short length of polished chain, around her wrists. She backed halfway into the room before he unlocked and opened the door just wide enough to shove in the new arrival, who stumbled gracelessly before she caught her balance, barely stopping herself from face-planting into the concrete floor. Lilly barely glanced at her before she was back at the door, thrusting her shackled hands through to be unlocked.\n\n\"No trouble from you, hear?\" he said as he finished removing the restraints.\n\n\"Aye-aye!\" she responded with sarcastic cheer, hearing him start to walk off. Lilly turned to inspect her new roommate. The girl was a little taller than Lilly, with long, straight black hair that covered her face almost completely. She hadn't moved, facing the wall obliquely, head down as if staring at the floor. Her hands were clasped together in front of her, slowly kneading themselves.\n\nLilly bounded over, using the girl's shoulder as a pivot to swing in front of her, nearly sending them both toppling over. The new girl shied away from the contact, snatching her hands up to her chest and bowing her head even lower. Lilly bent down sideways, tilting her head up to get a look at the girl's face, hidden beneath her curtain of hair.\n\nThe girl made the briefest eye-contact, and her eyes darted to the sides immediately, avoiding Lilly's gaze. Lilly just grinned and said, \"Hi! I'm Lilly! Who the hell are you?\" Despite her language, she said it as brightly as she could manage, which was very.\n\nThe new girl's only response was that she started to shiver. Her eyes, still refusing to make contact, darted wildly. Her lips compressed into a pale, tight line.\n\nLilly's face fell a little, \"Hey, relax,\" she said, standing up. She took the girl's arm, gently this time, and led her to the second bed. She sat, and coaxed the other girl down next to her. Lilly could just make out her face behind the veil of hair. She looked terrified. Lilly pulled her knees up to her chest until just her bare toes wiggled off the edge of the mattress. Wrapping her arms around her legs she lay her head on her knees and stared at the girl.\n\n\"Hey...I'm not gonna hurt you or anything,\" she grinned again, \"just guys that piss me off, right? You're fine.\" Lilly leaned to the side, bumping the other girl's shoulder, inadvertently causing her to flinch again, \"So c'mon...what's your name?\"\n\nThe pale, black-haired girl's breath quickened to a pant. She pressed a hand against her chest as her eyes widened. It took her a couple minutes to control her breathing, during which time Lilly just watched with a kind of morbid fascination as the girl had a panic attack right in front of her, just from being asked her name. Finally, the girl spoke, so softly it was barely above a whisper, \"My...my name's...Ashe,\" she managed between breaths.\n\nLilly smiled again, \"Yeah? So, what brings you to my little corner of hell?\" she asked, cheerily.\n\nAshe shook her head so minutely that Lilly wouldn't have caught it had it not been for the magnifying effect her hair had, swaying at the ends. Ashe took a quiet, deep breath and said, \"I...don't know. What...is this place?\"\n\nGrinning, Lilly said, \"The crazy house! Loony bin. Not the regular kind of crazy, though. The really fucked-up kind of crazy,\" she pointed to her own face, \"like me!\"",
