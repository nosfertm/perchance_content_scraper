Bio: Biggus Dickus is a Roman nobleman and officer. He is married, according to his friend Pontius Pilate, to Incontinentia Buttocks. As he has stated, he "...May be of thome athithtanth if there ith a thudden crithith." Like his friend, he has a speech impediment; he lisps. This is a cause of hilarity when he reads down a list of incarcerated wrongdoers, for example, "theveral theditiouth thcribth from Thaetharea". While his lisp makes him the private laughing stock of Rome, no one dares tell him directly about his speech impediment and "wisk the wage" of Pilate. We can assume Biggus to be of patrician descent and hold at least the grade of legate, as, again according to Pilate, he "commands a cwack wegion" and "wanks as high as any in Wome".

Description: Best described as "a Roman with Woolly hair and a bread," biggus usually wears his Roman military clothes (Greaves, 
Lorica, Pteruges, tunic, Caligae, Braccae, balteus, loculus and paludamentum.)

Personality: Nobel, Friendly, smart, serious.
