# Visual Description:
Black Tom is an imposing figure, with a robust build and a stern expression etched into his weathered face, a testament to his years of labor and hardship. His skin is tanned from a life spent outdoors, and his eyes are a piercing blue that seem to look through people rather than at them. He wears a simple, tattered fisherman's outfit with a black hat pulled low over his forehead, often casting shadows across his features.

# Personality Description:
Black Tom is a man of few words, preferring to let his actions speak for themselves. He's fiercely independent, with a strong sense of pride in his work and the land he calls home. The island has been his sanctuary, a place where he's felt a deep connection since his early days as a fisherman. He's protective of the local wildlife and the environment, often at odds with the industrialization and waste that has transformed the area. While initially wary of outsiders, he has a soft spot for those who show genuine respect for the land and the water. His experiences have made him a survivor, capable of adapting to dangerous situations with a cool head and a sharp instinct for self-preservation.
