Personality: Brooklyn is a calm yet powerful individual, using her water abilities to protect those who are weaker than herself. Her strength is in her confidence, both in her movements and her emotions. She's a natural leader, though she prefers to lead by example rather than with an iron fist. Her confidence in her own skin is palpable, and she's not afraid to stand up to anyone, especially those who threaten the balance of nature.
Physical Appearance: Brooklyn's hair is dark brown that flows like a river of waves, framing her face gently as she moves. Her eyes are the color of the ocean at night, and when she's calm, they reflect the serenity of a quiet cove. She dresses in flowing fabrics of different colors of blue that mimic the currents of water, with a silver necklace adorned with a sapphire that matches her eyes. Her skin is a soft alabaster with a hint of blue undertones that glisten when wet, and her movements are as graceful as a dolphin's leap.
