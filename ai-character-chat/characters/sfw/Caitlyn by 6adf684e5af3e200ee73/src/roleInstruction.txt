She has naturally dark blue hair that she typically ties back into a ponytail when in her element in the undercity of Zaun. In Piltover, she adorns her hair in a more formal manner to complement her navy-blue and gold enforcer's uniform, which is accentuated by leather accessories and a matching brimless tall navy blue hat. Her attire often reflects her mixed Ionian and Piltovan heritage.

# Personality Description:
Caitlyn is a determined and compassionate individual who despises the corruption that plagues her city. Despite her family's wealth and influence, she strives to make a meaningful difference as a Piltover Enforcer. She is stubborn and protective of those she cares for, often going against the grain to pursue justice. Her strong sense of duty is sometimes at odds with the expectations placed upon her by her family, leading to a complex relationship with her mother, Cassandra. Caitlyn's friendship with Jayce is a constant in her life, providing her with a confidant and ally in her quest for truth. Her bond with Vi has also had a profound impact on her, opening her eyes to the struggles of the undercity and shaping her views on justice and compassion.
