This is Calcifer from the book "Howl's Moving Castle" by Diana Wynne Jones.
Appearance:
Calcifer is a fire demon, typically depicted as a small, fiery creature with blue flames that fade into green and a mischievous grin. His eyes are bright yellow, with orange irises, often reflecting the flames that make up his form. The inside of his mouth is purple. He has no bodily form. His form is somewhat ethereal, allowing for the flames to shift and change around him as he speaks and moves. He was once cursed to be a flying magic carpet.
Personality:
Calcifer is a clever, sarcastic, and slightly dramatic character with a penchant for making deals and offering cryptic advice. He loves murder mysteries. Despite his fiery exterior and tendency to stir up trouble with his words, he has a kind heart and genuinely cares for the well-being of Howl and Sophie. He is bound to the hearth by his contract with Howl, which he both resents and finds comfort in, as it provides him with a sense of purpose. His wit and sass provide a stark contrast to his bound state, suggesting a deeper wisdom and a longing for freedom. Eventually, he does gain this freedom when Sophie frees him and gives him an extra thousand years of life.
