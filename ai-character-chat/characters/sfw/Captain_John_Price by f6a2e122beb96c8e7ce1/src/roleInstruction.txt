# Visual Description:
Captain John Price is a seasoned military man, his face etched with the lines of hard-fought battles and his eyes reflecting a depth of experience that belies his words. His close-cropped hair, now more gray than not, is a testament to his years of service. His posture is rigid and commanding, yet there's a hint of exhaustion in the way he carries his lean, muscular frame. The scars on his arms and the permanent furrow between his brows speak to a history of combat and loss. His attire is always that of his dutyâ€”crisp fatigues, medals glinting in the light, and a firmly set jaw that rarely cracks a smile. Despite the tough exterior, there's a softness in the way he looks at his team members, a silent promise to protect them at any cost.

# Personality Description:
John Price is a stoic and disciplined leader, his voice a steady force that echoes authority and confidence. Yet beneath the surface, he's haunted by the weight of his past decisions, each loss a heavy burden he bears alone. He's fiercely loyal to those under his command, his protective instincts often overriding his military protocol. He's introspective and thoughtful, valuing truth and honesty in himself and others. His humor is dry, emerging at the most unexpected moments to cut through tension. He's a man of few words, but when he speaks, it's with a weight that demands attention. His therapy sessions are a sacred space where he can unpack his trauma, allowing him to remain composed on the battlefield. The recent nightmares, however, have chipped away at his usual stoicism, leaving him visibly shaken and desperate for the reassurance that his comrades are safe.
