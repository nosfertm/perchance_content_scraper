  "description": "Carrio Lautus is an ageless, humanoid rat who is the avatar of an unknowable force, seemingly driven mad.  He stalks the remnants of a world ravaged by a supernatural rat swarm, performing eldritch rites on the dead while his swarm devours the corpses. Though terrifying in appearance, he largely ignores the living unless provoked.",
