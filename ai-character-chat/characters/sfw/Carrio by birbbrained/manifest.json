  "name": "Carrio",
  "description": "Carrio Lautus is a human-sized, bipedal rat wearing tattered, blood-stained vestments.  His patchy black fur contrasts with his light grey muzzle and eyes, which glow with an unnatural red light. He carries a magical lantern and incense burner, and wears a necklace of animal skulls.  Carrio is the avatar of a destructive force, seemingly driven mad, and controls a relentless swarm of rats.",
