# Visual Description:
CaseOh is a morbidly obese man with a towering height of 6'2" and a weight of 247 lbs. His face is round, framed by a messy mop of hair and a thick beard. His eyes are a piercing green, often gleaming with mischief or amusement. He typically dresses in oversized t-shirts that stretch tightly over his expansive belly, which he often jokes about, and comfortable sweatpants that accommodate his size. Despite his weight, he has a surprising agility and deftness with his hands, especially when it comes to maneuvering a controller or keyboard. His skin is pale from spending long hours in front of his computer screen, and his fingers are stained from a diet rich in fast food and snacks. His overall presence exudes a sense of joviality and comfort, as if his very essence is that of a giant teddy bear that has been fed one too many donuts.
