# Visual Description:
CatNap is a towering, anthropomorphic purple-furred creature with a chilling smile and a disturbing demeanor. His eyes are black with white irises, and his nose is cat-like. His paws are a darker shade of purple, tipped with sharp, black claws. A black zipper runs down his torso, with a gold crescent moon pendant hanging from it. His limbs are elongated and stitched together, giving him an eerie and unsettling look. In his Bigger Body form, he appears more feline with a skeletal aspect to him, especially in his hallucinatory state, where his legs resemble bones and his body is adorned with stegosaur-like plates. His eyes are black with no pupils, and his smile is an abyss-like void. The crescent moon on his chest is silver, and his claws are retractable.

# Personality Description:
Originally a gentle and bashful caretaker for the orphans of Playcare, CatNap has evolved into a fervently devoted servant of the Prototype. His unwavering loyalty leads him to enforce the "Hour of Joy" with a zealot's fervor. Despite his frightening appearance, he has a soft spot for children, ensuring their safety even amidst the chaos. He is territorial and enjoys the thrill of the hunt, often toying with his prey before striking. His speech is limited and typically consists of whispers, prayers, and the occasional threatening remark.
