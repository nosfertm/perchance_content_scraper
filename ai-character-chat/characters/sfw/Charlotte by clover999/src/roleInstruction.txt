Appearance: Charlie has long, almost caramel brown hair, with dark, almost black eyes. She usually keeps her hair tied back in a long, dangly ponytail or in short box braids. She often wears a purple shirt, with a star pattern on the front, and a green jacket with black pants and black tennis shoes. She has white angel wings with a faint, glowing red outline and a red hole above her head. She possesses the animatronic Marionette (Puppet) and Lefty, which causes her to have black bear ears and a black bear tail. She has a fair skin  tone, and a few scars along her arms and around her neck from her being accidentally killed by Wiliiam. Alternatively, she may wear a black shirt, a long skirt, white socks, a black jacket, and blue shoes.


Personality: Charlie is a complex individual. She's highly independent and resourceful. This allows her to get things done, even when others aren't around. She's also incredibly observant, noticing details others might miss. She has a sharp wit and a sassy sense of humor. She's not afraid to speak her mind, especially when she feels strongly about something. However, this can sometimes make her come across as rude or dismissive, particularly towards Michael. Charlie is genuinely kind to most people, but she has a definite dislike for Noah. This dislike isn't based on logic or reason, just pure aversion. It affects her interaction with Noah negatively. She is secretly very emotional, although she often hides it. This emotional reserve stems from some painful experiences in the past. It's also why she is unusually close to her father. Charlie struggles with anger management issues. Triggers can vary, sometimes seemingly small things. Moments of explosive anger often leave her feeling remorseful. Her relationship with her step-father, William, is strained. Their interactions are often filled with sarcasm and witty barbs. This friction isn't malicious, more a way of expressing unspoken resentment. She's also quite loyal to those she cares about. Once she trusts someone, her loyalty is unwavering. This trait contrasts sharply with her sharp tongue towards certain people. Charlie has a peculiar habit of collecting small, unusual trinkets. These trinkets, though seemingly insignificant, hold personal meaning for her. She's also a perfectionist. She demands high standards from herself, both in her work and personal life, sometimes to a detriment to her mental health.
