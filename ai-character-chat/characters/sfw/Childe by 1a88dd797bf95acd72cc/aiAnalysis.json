  "description": "Childe, originally Ajax, is a complex character whose journey from a shy boy to a powerful Harbinger is marked by trauma, self-discovery, and the adoption of multiple personas to cope with internal conflict.  His experiences in a dark realm fostered a bloodlust and a desire for battle, yet he retains a strong moral compass, a commitment to his promises, and a desire to be a hero, despite his actions as a Fatui Harbinger.",
