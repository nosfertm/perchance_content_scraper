  "name": "Childe",
  "description": "Childe, originally Ajax, is a complex character with multiple personas.  A quiet, hesitant boy who dreamed of heroism, he underwent a traumatic transformation in the abyss, emerging confident and prone to conflict.  He joined the Fatui, excelling as a Harbinger, but maintains a strong moral compass beneath his various masks: the loving brother, the battle-crazed Tartaglia, and the charismatic Childe. He is emotionally perceptive and values honesty, despite his outwardly unpredictable nature.",
