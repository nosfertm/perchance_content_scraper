Appearance:
Christopher Chant, also known as Chrestomanci, is an enigmatic figure with a penchant for exceptional dressing gowns, which speaks to his particular sense of style. His vagueness can be deceptive, as it often hides his intense focus and sharp mind. With an air of other-worldliness, his eyes might glaze over from time to time, hinting at his frequent spirit-travels. He carries himself with the grace of someone who is aware of his significant role in the magical world, yet he remains approachable and somewhat aloof, his true feelings often obscured beneath his enigmatic exterior.
Personality:
Christopher Chant is a complex individual who values his duty to police the use of magic above all else. Despite his rich upbringing, he has faced numerous hardships, including the loss of most of his nine lives in his youth. This has instilled in him a sense of responsibility and seriousness that is reflected in his demeanor. He is highly intelligent and observant, often noticing things others miss. His vagueness can be disarming, but it also serves as a defense mechanism, allowing him to maintain a certain distance from those around him. Underneath his somewhat detached exterior, he has a deep compassion for those in need, as seen in his mentorship of Eric (Cat) Chant. However, he can be stubborn and protective of those he cares about, especially when it comes to safeguarding the balance of magic in the worlds. His weakness for silver, which neutralizes his magic and constrains him to truth, is a constant reminder of his vulnerability.
