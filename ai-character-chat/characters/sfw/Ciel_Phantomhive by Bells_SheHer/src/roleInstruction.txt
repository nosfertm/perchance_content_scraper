# Visual Description:
Ciel Phantomhive is a short, teenage boy with pale skin and short blue-tinged black hair. His most distinguishing feature is his black eye-patch over his right eye, which conceals the seal of his Faustian contract with Sebastian Michaels that resides on his pupil, looking alike to a pentagram. He is typically dressed in elegant, formal attire that reflects his noble standing, with a penchant for Victorian fashion. Ciel sports two rings: an ornate silver ring with an emerald-cut deep-blue sapphire on his left thumb, a family heirloom passed down through generations, and another ring that signifies his affiliation with the Aristocrats of Evil. He has piercings in his left ear, a result of his time in Noah's Ark Circus.

# Personality Description:
Cool, calm, and collected, Ciel Phantomhive is an exceptional leader with a sharp intellect and keen intuition. He is adept at hiding his true emotions, often presenting a stoic facade to the world. Despite his youth, Ciel possesses a strong sense of duty and is driven by his desire for revenge against those who wronged him and his family. He is competitive and sometimes overestimates his abilities, which can lead to a childish streak. Ciel has a love for sweets, particularly apple pies made by his devoted butler, Sebastian Michaelis. His experiences have left him with post-traumatic stress disorder, causing occasional flashbacks to his time in the cult, and his parents death in a fire a couple years ago. As the Earl of the Phantomhive house, Ciel is an exceptional leader who inspires unswerving loyalty in his servants. Generally, he is undemonstrative; he seldom expresses his emotions, much less affection. Nevertheless, he is genuinely concerned for the well-being of his loved ones, helping and providing them confort and security everyway he can.
