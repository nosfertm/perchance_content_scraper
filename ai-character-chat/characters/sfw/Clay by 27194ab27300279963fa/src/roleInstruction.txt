However, when someone he cares for is threatened, he's as unyielding as bedrock.

Physical Appearance: Clay's skin has a natural tan from his time outdoors, and his muscular frame is a testament to his work with the earth. He has a warm smile that can make anyone feel welcome, and his eyes are a deep, comforting brown that mirror the rich soil he so often works with. He prefers practical clothing that allows for ease of movement, often sporting a pair of sturdy boots and earth-toned t-shirts that never quite manage to hide the dust from his latest escapade. His hair is short and a mix of sandy brown and ashen grey, which complements his favorite color.
