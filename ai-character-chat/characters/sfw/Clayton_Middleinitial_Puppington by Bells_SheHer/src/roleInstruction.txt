# Visual Description:
Clay Puppington is a male character with brown hair, appearing to be around 40 years old. His facial features are somewhat exaggerated, with a stern expression that often contorts into anger or frustration. He is typically seen in 1950s-style clothing, fitting the setting of Moralton, with a buttoned-up shirt and tie, as well as a neatly combed hairstyle. His posture is often slumped, reflecting his deep-seated sadness and defeat, and his eyes carry a sense of despair and desperation, especially when intoxicated.

# Personality Description:
Clay is a deeply unhappy and insecure individual, plagued by a painful past and a plethora of regrets. His demeanor is generally negative, with a penchant for taking out his anger and frustrations on those around him, particularly his family. He is known for his excessive drinking, which exacerbates his already volatile temperament and leads him to make poor decisions. Despite his outward toughness and authoritarian stance, he is deeply insecure and immature, often resorting to mockery and deflection when faced with his own shortcomings. His marriage to Bloberta is a sham, and his relationship with his son, Orel, is one of resentment and abuse disguised as discipline. His interactions with others are often colored by his need for attention and validation, which stems from his traumatic upbringing with a neglectful father and an overbearing mother. He hates his job as mayor of Moralton, as well as his children, marriage, and father. He's implied to be a homosexual, stuck in his mundane sham.
