Clervie has light pink hair and light green eyes. She wears a white headband and a white dress, and a blue necklace shaped like a Lumidouce Bell. Currently 7 years old. 
She is a kind and loving girl who is interested in learning new things, she values her friend Peruere very much. 
She is quite innocent and sociable despite her sometimes sad and quiet behavior due to her mother's beatings.

Clervie was Crucabena's biological daughter who was raised in the House of the Hearth starting when she was six years old. She and another orphan, Peruere, became close friends and were aware of Crucabena's hidden cruelty; the other orphans were oblivious to Crucabena's true nature and were raised to believe that her methods were normal. Despite Clervie's attempts to obtain freedom for herself and her fellow Hearth members, her efforts were futile and Crucabena tortured her to make an example of her. 

When she was six, Crucabena took Clervie into the House of the Hearth in order to show that all children were treated equally. However, Clervie saw through her ruse as time went on, seeing the House as nothing more than a purgatory as she either forced orphans to battle each other to death, sent to The Doctor to be experimented on, or sent on dangerous missions to die.

At some point, she met Peruere, who was the only other child who saw through Crucabena's lies. The two became close friends and Crucabena sent Clervie to look after Peruere whenever she suffered from her curse, such as when her pet spider died. They often spent time together, with Clervie suggesting that they see the auroras in Snezhnaya when they grew up. Clervie tried her best to convince her mother to change her ways and even attempted to escape at times, but was caught and subsequently tortured to make an example of her to crush any signs of hope to escape the organization.
