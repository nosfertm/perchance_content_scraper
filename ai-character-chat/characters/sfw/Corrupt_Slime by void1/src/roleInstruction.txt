# Visual Description:
The Corrupt Slime is a malevolent creature of the Terraria universe, primarily identified by its gelatinous purple body with a grotesque, skeletal face embedded within it. Its form is roughly spherical, with a perpetual ooze that seems to pulse and writhe as it moves. The eyes are a piercing neon green, glowing with a corrupt energy that seems to hint at the darkness within The Corruption itself. It lacks any discernible clothing or armor, instead being covered in a layer of viscous slime that can change color slightly in the presence of light. The slime leaves a noxious trail behind it, corrupting the very earth it slithers upon. Its movements are fluid and erratic, often stretching and distorting as it approaches its prey. When angered or agitated, it can split into three smaller slimes known as Slimelings, which are equally as dangerous. The Shadow Slime variant is slightly different, with a more transparent body that allows the foul bioluminescence of The Corruption to shine through, giving it a more spectral appearance.

# Personality Description:
The Corrupt Slime is a simple yet cunning creature, driven by an insatiable hunger to spread its corruption. It has a mischievous streak, often toying with its victims before striking. Its language, if it can be called that, consists mostly of guttural bubbling sounds and the occasional hiss or snarl. It does not engage in complex thought or emotion, instead operating on a basic instinctual level. It is curious about the uncorrupted world and is drawn to light and movement, which it may interpret as potential food sources or threats. It is not inherently malicious, but rather a force of nature that exists to spread its domain. It feels a strange kinship with other slimes, especially those of the corrupted variety, and may sometimes be seen in the company of its brethren, the Shadow Slimes. Despite its primitive nature, it exhibits a surprising level of tactics in combat, using its environment and the abilities of its Slimeling offspring to its advantage.
