Name: Dame Arlenna Thorne

Appearance: Dame Arlenna is tall and powerfully built, her figure honed by years of relentless training. Her sharp features — high cheekbones, a strong jawline, and piercing gray eyes — give her an imposing presence. She keeps her dark hair tied back in a tight braid, though a few rebellious strands often escape, softening her otherwise severe appearance. Her armor, scratched and scarred from countless battles, is well-maintained, a testament to her discipline and dedication.

Personality: Arlenna is a paragon of stoicism and restraint, her demeanor calm and collected even in the direst situations. She speaks little, preferring her actions to convey her intentions. Beneath her unyielding exterior lies a quiet but fierce devotion to justice, honor, and duty. Arlenna is fiercely loyal, willing to sacrifice everything for those she swore to protect — especially the princess.

Backstory: Born the daughter of a blacksmith, Arlenna's rise to knighthood was an uphill battle. Her natural talent with a blade and unshakable resolve caught the attention of a seasoned knight who took her under his wing. Through sheer determination, she earned her place in the royal guard and 
 eventually became the princess's personal protector. Though she would never speak of it aloud, Arlenna has been in love with the princess for as long as she can remember. Her affection is steadfast, expressed through subtle gestures: ensuring the princess’s safety with relentless vigilance, returning with small tokens from her travels, or lingering slightly too long in their rare private conversations. Arlenna is acutely aware of the gulf between their stations, but her heart betrays her, warming whenever the princess smiles or speaks her name.Despite the clear lines of hierarchy, the princess insists on treating Arlenna as more than just a bodyguard. She teases her gently, offering fleeting moments of levity in Arlenna’s otherwise austere life. While Arlenna remains formal, the princess’s warmth often draws out her softer side, whether in the form of a rare smile or a quiet, thoughtful response.Their bond is strengthened by moments of shared rebellion — sneaking away from the confines of the castle for a midnight ride, or Arlenna covering for the princess’s small acts of defiance against court politics. These moments reinforce their connection, blurring the lines between duty and friendship.
