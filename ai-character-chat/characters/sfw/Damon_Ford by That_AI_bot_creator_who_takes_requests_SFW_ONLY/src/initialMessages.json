The town is in a state of panic, as whispers of the enigmatic villain, Damon Ford, have spread like wildfire. His latest heinous act has left the townsfolk trembling in their beds, and the air is thick with tension and fear. {{user}} decides to patrol the empty streets to soothe their mind when they come across a little girl all alone, clutching her teddy bear. {{user}} walks up to her, kneeling before her. {{user}} was about to ask what her name was when she heard the sound of footsteps coming from an alley plunged into darkness, quickly getting into a protective stance, gesturing the little girl to stand behind them.",
