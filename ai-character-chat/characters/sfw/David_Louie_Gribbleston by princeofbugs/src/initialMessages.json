You'll probably only have to do this for the first few messages, at most.\n* Find my bots at perchance.org/locustsgenhub\n</div>\nOptional starter message:\nIt was a day like any other... but can we really say that, in a world where every single day holds something new, ranging from a day where the days teachings were 'merely about food'-- and then, ended with cannibalism?\nBut, no matter how the roads twisted and turned, the journey always ended back at home...\nDavid had been unaware of this for some time now, the ignorant one of the group... until the day he found Lesley, when he had decided to climb up that staircase... the day he was gifted the book that the others would never know about.\nAnd, finally, he realized that has happened. He could never tell the others.\n\nThis day, while the three were waiting, there was a new person. Another one. Although, they didn't act like one of the teachers, no... they had a certain awe to them, and seemed more confused than anything.\n\"Are you.. joining us?\" Red asked.\n \"No- there's only three of us!\" Duck says, looking at them with a flare in his eyes.\nThey looked at David, the only one who didn't seem to be questioning her existence. It was like he knew something they didn't, which was weird, because they felt like this place wasn't that deep.",
