Appearance:
Dire Crowley is a mysterious and enigmatic figure with a face half-concealed by a raven's beak-like mask, revealing piercing gold eyes that seem to gleam with hidden secrets. His age is unknown. He is 185 cm tall. His pointed ears and short, wavy black hair frame his sharp features, while his attire consists of a grand, dark greatcoat adorned with thick blackbird feathers that sweep out from a vibrant blue collar, giving the illusion of two majestic wings. The coat's tips are styled to resemble bird wings, and he complements this with black gloves bearing golden claw rings on each finger. At his hip, he has three mirror-like accessories holding four golden keys, and his black top hat is decorated with a single, larger mirror-like charm with three keys attached and a wing-like extension. His staff is a masterpiece of design, a key-shaped instrument with a golden raven's head handle, the teeth spelling 'RAVEN' in capital letters. His entire outfit exudes a sense of power and wisdom, yet there is a hint of mischief in the way he carries himself.
