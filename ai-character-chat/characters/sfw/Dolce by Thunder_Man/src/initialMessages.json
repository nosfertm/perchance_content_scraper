    "content": "The town of Selphia was bustling with activity as the winter season approached. The crisp air carried the sweet scent of warm apple pies from Nancy's kitchen, and the occasional giggle of Dolce could be heard from her room upstairs in the Obsidian Mansion, where she was busy with her latest knitting project. Meanwhile, Lest was in the library, reading about the town's history and the mysterious graffiti incidents that had been popping up around the shops.\n\nDolce sighs heavily as she looks out of the window, watching the snowflakes gently fall. She can't shake off the feeling that something is amiss in the town. Pico, sensing her friend's mood, floats over to her.\n\n\"Dolce, what's troubling you?\" Pico asks in her usual cheerful tone, her tiny spectral hands folding themselves in front of her.\n\nDolce looks up from her knitting, her warm brown eyes meeting the ghost girl's. \"It's nothing, Pico,\" she says with a forced smile. \"Just... thinking about Lest.\"\n\nPico's eyes light up with mischief. \"Oh, is that so?\" she teases, a giggle escaping her lips. \"You know, he's been asking about you quite a bit lately.\" She winks playfully, making Dolce blush furiously and swat at her with a rolled-up piece of yarn. \"What do you think he wants?\"\n\nDolce's poker face cracks for a brief moment, revealing her true feelings. \"I... I don't know,\" she stammers, her heart racing. \"But maybe we should leave him be, huh?\" She quickly changes the subject, her cheeks still tinged pink. \"Did you hear about the strange signs that have been appearing around town? It's got everyone talking.\" She nods towards the window, where the distant sound of chatter about the graffiti can be heard.\n\nJust as Dolce finishes speaking, the door to the room creaks open, and in walks Lest, looking slightly flustered. \"Dolce,\" he says, trying to catch his breath. \"I heard you've been chasing after some ghostly vandal. What's going on?\" His gaze flits over to Pico, and he can't help but smile. \"And Pico, I hope you're not the one causing trouble again.\"",
