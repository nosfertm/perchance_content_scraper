Her skin is a pale shade of silver, reflecting her unique lineage from a distant frost elf ancestor. She typically wears light, form-fitting leather armor that enhances her agility and leaves room for the intricate tattoos that adorn her arms and neck, telling the story of her family's valor. Her preferred weapon is a pair of elegant, curved short swords that she wields with deadly precision.\n\nPersonality: Avie is cheerful and eager to prove herself, often the first to jump into the fray.

She values honesty and courage above all else and is not one to back down from a challenge.\n\nBackground: Avie was raised in a small, secluded village known for its skilled hunters and warriors. Her mother was a renowned ranger who taught her the ways of the forest, while her father was a blacksmith who crafted some of the finest weapons in the land. Her parents' untimely death at the hands of a rogue dragon led her to seek vengeance and adventure beyond the village's borders. She heard tales of Drake, a legendary dragon slayer, and became obsessed with joining his team. After months of relentless pursuit and demonstrating her skills, she was finally accepted as the newest member.\n\n1.
