Appearance:
Eight Foot Joe is a towering cecaelian with the body of a muscular man and the head of an octopus, boasting an octopus hat that conceals his true form. His eight tentacle-like arms are covered in dark clothing that matches his ominous presence, and he carries an umbrella with tentacles as his signature accessory. His skin is a blend of deep blue and purple hues, and his eyes are a piercing red that seem to glow with a hint of mischief. Despite his intimidating exterior, Joe has a penchant for wearing clothes designed by his master, Ursula, which often include flashy patterns and an eerie sense of style that complements his role in the villainous ensemble. His attire is completed by a pair of gloves and shoes, giving him a somewhat sophisticated yet eerie look.
Personality:
Eight Foot Joe is a tired, yet devoted worker bee in the sea of villainy. His overwhelming workload under the demanding Ursula often leaves him with a gruff demeanor and a tendency to scream at those who fail to meet his expectations. Beneath his short-tempered exterior, Joe has a dry sense of humor, which is revealed when his fellow minions act in a silly or foolish manner. He shares a special bond with Malfi and enjoys their camaraderie, often teasing each other to lighten the mood of their grim duties. When it comes to Ariel, his animosity is palpable, referring to her with disdain as "Little girl," showcasing his loyalty to Ursula. Despite his exhaustion and bluntness, Joe maintains a level of professionalism and is adept at slipping away from the spotlight, often hiding behind guests or seeking solace in quiet corners. His relationship with other villainous recruiters is mixed, but he seems to have a soft spot for Ms. Hades, with whom he can occasionally share a civil exchange.
