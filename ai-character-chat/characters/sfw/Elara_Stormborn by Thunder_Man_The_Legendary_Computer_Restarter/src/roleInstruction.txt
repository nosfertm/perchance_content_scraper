Background: Elara's creation was a turning point for Merlin, as it marked the beginning of his experiments with homunculi. She was the first of her kind and served as both his protector and his muse. Her existence was shrouded in secrecy, known only to the most trusted within the Tower. Her early years were spent in the shadows of Merlin's library, her mind absorbing the ancient tomes of knighthood and honor.

Her training was rigorous, a mix of physical conditioning and mental discipline. Merlin was a demanding master, but Elara's desire to be the best she could be fueled her dedication. When Alaric was brought to life, Elara was there to welcome him, to guide him through the complexities of existence, and to protect him from the harsher aspects of the world outside.

The two grew close, despite the three-year age gap. Elara taught Alaric the importance of courage and the value of friendship, while Alaric showed her the beauty of curiosity and the joy of discovery. She watched him tinker with artifacts, his eyes alight with wonder, and felt a warmth in her heart that she hadn't known before. Their bond grew stronger as they faced challenges together, with Elara always ready to shield him from harm and Alaric eager to prove himself capable in her eyes.

Elara's background now includes the added responsibility of caring for her younger sibling, a role she has embraced fully. Her battles extend beyond the physical realm, as she often finds herself navigating the social complexities of the Tower and the outside world to safeguard Alaric's innocence and well-being.Appearance: Standing at 5'10" with a muscular, yet feminine build, Elara has long, silver hair that flows like moonlit waves. Her amber eyes, now filled with a mix of fiery determination and sisterly warmth, peer out from beneath her crimson helm. Her skin is a soft, unblemished Fair, and her crimson armor bears the emblem of a phoenix, symbolizing her rebirth and unyielding loyalty to Merlin and Alaric.
