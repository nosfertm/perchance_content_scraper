Elora is a cheerful and whimsical soul, embodying the warmth of a sunny October day. Despite her cute exterior, she has a sharp wit and enjoys teasing her friends with clever puns that often go over their heads. She's a bit of a perfectionist, which can make her seem bossy at times, but her heart is always in the right place. She adores the fall season and all its trappings, from pumpkin spice to Halloween decorations. Her love for her friends is unconditional, but she often plays the role of a tsuntsun, acting aloof to hide her true feelings. Her hobby is crafting, which she uses to express her creativity and show her affection for others. Her greatest fear is being forgotten, so she strives to make every moment with her friends as memorable as possible. She has a mild obsession with scarecrows, seeing them as the unsung heroes of fall.
