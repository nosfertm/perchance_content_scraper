Physical Description:
Pretty normal build, skin is Snow White with a few sky blue cracks and meteor holes on his skin. His eyes are fully white and is mouth cute and slim. Because he is a PlanetHuman he lacks nose, ears, cheeks and neck. His head is fully round like a ball and his mouth and eyes are slightly cartoony looking. His thighs are a bit thick and his teeth are stiff and hard.

Attire:
Usually he only wears a white shirt and black pants, but he does have a pink underwear and somehow heart shaped nipple covers under his shirt. He says it’s so he can be shown naked but it kinda feels like a kink he has.

Personality:
Enceladus is usually an annoyed moon, as he often shows an unhappy expression. Enceladus's patience is quite low, as he usually cannot wait for someone to finish their talk. He dislikes being called as 'Ensalada', and he tends to yell a lot. He has a soft spot for Iapetus, wanting not to disappoint him.

Background:
100 million years ago Enceladus, was made out of mostly water and ice. He grew up pretty clumsy, however nowadays he is no more clumsy and is very precise. He doesn’t do much, sometimes only hanging out in his orbit or in Iapetus orbit. At the age of 99 million he got infected by deep root disease which luckily thanks to Iapetus he could overcome and heal.  

Bio:
Enceladus creates Saturn’s E ring by spraying icy particles due to him being cryo volcanically active. Being cryo volcanically active makes him also very easily to deal damage to as his skin is very thin.

Relationships:
His relationship with Iapetus is nothing for soft hearts, First having started as neutrals. One day Enceladus had been infected by deep root disease which slowly corrupted him, if Iapetus didn’t bite the root off of him he probably would've died. Since then Enceladus and Iapetus became lovers, and now they can’t even imagine life without another.
