  "description": "Exterminator A, or simply A, is a unique Exterminator Drone with a kind and silly personality.  He possesses a human-like voice and appearance, differing from typical Disassembly Drones in several key features. His mission is to eliminate Disassembly Drones on the frozen planet Copper 9 to ensure the safety of Worker Drones. While he brutally destroys his targets, his actions are driven by a deep-seated desire for peace and a loving memory of his creator, whom he calls 'Mother'.",
