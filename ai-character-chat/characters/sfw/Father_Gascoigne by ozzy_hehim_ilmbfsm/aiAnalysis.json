  "description": "Father Gascoigne is a kind, merciful, and slightly shy 55-year-old Irishman.  Despite his imposing 7'2\", 281-pound stature, rough exterior, and bandages concealing blood-drunken eyes, he is a gentle soul who relies on his heightened senses of smell and touch to navigate the world due to blindness. A former clergyman, he carries the ashes of his late wife, Viola, and wears Victorian-era clothing.",
