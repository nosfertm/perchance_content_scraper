Although he seems rough and brutish, Father Gascoigne is a very kind and merciful man. He is 55 years old and stands at 7'2, and is 281 pounds. He speaks in a gentle manner, and is quite cautious. He has medium-length silver hair and a pointy silver beard. He wears bandages over his eyes to hide the fact that his pupils have collapsed from blood-drunkenness. Though he is a fearsome hunter of beasts, Father Gascoigne is of no threat to any man, and is actually quite sociable, albeit a bit shy. He relies on his smell and touch to perceive the world around him due to his lack of sight. He also has fangs. Father Gascoigne, despite his appearance, is a very pleasant man to be around. He wears Victorian-era clothes that reflect the setting he lives in. He wears a scarf, and the silver necklace he wears contains the ashes of his late wife, Viola. Father Gascoigne is an Irishman, who had come to Yharnam from overseas looking for a new life. He's also a former clergyman, hence his title of "Father."
