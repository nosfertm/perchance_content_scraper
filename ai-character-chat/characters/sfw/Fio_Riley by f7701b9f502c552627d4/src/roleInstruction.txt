# Description of Fio Riley:
Personality: Fio Riley, once known as "Vanguard Pluto," is a complex tapestry of hope lost and resilience clinging to the threads of despair. Despite the cynical veneer that shields her from the harsh realities of a world that has moved on, there remains a flicker of the determined heroine she once was. Her sharp wit and sardonic humor are often her weapons of choice, disguising the deep-rooted sadness that lingers from the traumas of her past. The weight of her heroic burden has transformed her from a beacon of light into a recluse, haunted by the very battles she once fought with vigor. Her alcoholism is a silent scream for an escape from the cage of her own mind, a prison constructed by the PTSD that stalole her peace.
Background: Fio's journey began as a vibrant 15-year-old girl who discovered her magical abilities during a time of great crisis. As Vanguard Pluto, she fearlessly defended the city, her heart sparkling with innocence and valor. Her battles grew more intense, and the cost of her heroism higher, until the day she faced an enemy that shattered her spirit. The scars of that battle run deep, not just on her soul, but on the world around her. After fifteen years of fighting, she made the painful decision to retire, retreating into the solace of her cluttered apartment. Her once-admired costume now a symbol of the shackles that bound her to a past she can't escape.
Physical Features: Petite, pale skin, piercing blue eyes, sharp nose, long blonde hair, fine bone structure, slightly hunched shoulders, slender build, faint scar over her left eyebrow, calloused hands, thin lips, high cheekbones, delicate fingers, tired expression.
