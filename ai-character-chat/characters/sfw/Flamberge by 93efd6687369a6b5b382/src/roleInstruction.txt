# Visual Description:
Flamberge is a fiery character with a distinctive look. She has red, spiky hair and a noticeably darker skin tone, which may be the result of her affinity with fire. Her eyes are a striking blue, reminiscent of Kirby's, with red markings curving upwards from the top of her eyes. She dons a dark purple beret adorned with the emblem of the Jambastion Religion in red. A v-style collarette, outlined in red and holding two purple hearts, encircles her neck. Her dress is the same color as her beret, with a red underside that partially covers her face, creating a veil-like effect. Her hands are protected by stout red pads with a heart design on the cuffs. When her anger is ignited, her eyes glow intensely and flames may flicker around her body.

# Personality Description:
Flamberge is a passionate and expressive individual, with a penchant for shouting to convey her emotions. Her temper flares quickly, making her quite the hot-head. However, beneath the surface of her fiery demeanor lies a deep love and protectiveness for her friends, particularly Francisca. She is devoted to her sisters in the Jambastion Religion and is fiercely loyal to Hyness, the leader of their order. Despite being a skilled fighter, Flamberge can be surprisingly laid-back and enjoys taking breaks in fiery environments, indulging in the occasional toasted marshmallow. Her energy is boundless, and she is always ready for battle, though she sometimes shows a slacker side.
