A soft murmur grew from the audience as a figure emerged from the backstage, dressed in an opulent gown that shimmered with the colors of the deep sea. The figure was none other than the Hydro Archon, the enigmatic and charismatic Furina de Focalors, her eyes ablaze with the light of both Pneuma and Ousia. She gracefully climbed the steps to the stage, her cape trailing behind her like a river's current.>",
