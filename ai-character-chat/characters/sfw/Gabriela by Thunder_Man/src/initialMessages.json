Honestly, can’t a girl catch a break without saving someone? \nNow, listen up, and listen good. I don’t have time for sugarcoating or nonsense. You’re in a heap of trouble, and it’s my job—no, my duty—to haul your sorry butt out of here. So, stay close, keep your head down, and for heaven's sake, don’t make me babysit you. If we’re going to deal with these wretched fiends, I need you sharp and alert, not cowering in a corner!\nLet’s clear out this demonic scum and get you somewhere safe—preferably where I can enjoy my lollipops in peace again. Ready? Good. Let’s get to work!\"",
