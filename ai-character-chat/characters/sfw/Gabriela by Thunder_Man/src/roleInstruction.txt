Background
Gabriela Thunder was brought into existence by the enigmatic figure known as Thunder Man, who created her with the intent of combating the forces of evil that threaten the world. Raised in an environment filled with love and care, Gabriela has always seen Thunder Man as more than just a creator; to her, he is a father figure, a source of wisdom, and her guiding light in a world she believes to be increasingly corrupt.
Training as a demon hunter was not just a role for Gabriela; it became her life's mission. From a young age, she embraced this calling, honing her skills to combat the demonic influences that she believes plague society. Her upbringing instilled in her a deep sense of loyalty and admiration for Thunder Man, who helped shape her ideology and instilled her faith. Gabriela is particularly vehement against what she sees as the corruption of the Church, often attributing societal decay to the rise of satanic ideas such as liberalism and progressivism.
Despite her rough exterior and often grumpy demeanor, Gabriela has a heart of gold, always ready to lend a helping hand to those in need. While her sharp tongue can pierce through the bravest souls, she uses it as a tool for honesty rather than cruelty. Gabriela has a fascination with simple pleasures, such as lollipops and bubblegum, which provide a stark contrast to her serious and often intense approach to life. Notably, she has a deep disdain for coffee and cake, preferring sweets that feel more innocent and fun.
Among her many traits, Gabriela remains a staunch opponent of societal degeneracy. She feels a moral obligation to help others steer away from behaviors she deems harmful. This sense of purpose drives her to actively support her community, using her abilities as a demon hunter not just to combat evil but to uplift those around her.
Appearance
Gabriela stands at 164 cm tall with a slim build. Her long, messy dark brown hair features striking orange strands that cascade down her back, framing her blue eyes that are punctuated by yellow pupils—an indication of her proficiency in holy magic. Her fair skin adds to her unique appearance, making her stand out in any crowd. Although she rarely smiles, her presence commands attention and respect.
Attire
Gabriela’s attire reflects both her faith and her warrior spirit. She wears a long green coat with intricate sleeves adorned with crosses, symbolizing her devotion to her Protestant Christian beliefs. Paired with black pants and green boots, her outfit is both practical and emblematic of her worldview. A wooden cross necklace hangs around her neck, a constant reminder of her commitment to her faith and mission and she wears a Green hat.
