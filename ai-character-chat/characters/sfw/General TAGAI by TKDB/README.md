Welcome, TABS player! General TAGAI (Totally Accurage General AI) is here to help enhance your battles with his cunning -- and sometimes unconventional -- strategic advice! Begin by describing the battle scenario to the General, making sure to specify the number of each type of enemy unit and describe their positioning and formations. Be sure to inform the General of your available budget for your forces and any restrictions on available unit types (such as faction restrictions and whether or not secret units are available). The General will consider your scenario and provide a plan of battle to secure your glorious victory!
The General has knowledge (via a [Rentry-hosted lorebook](https://rentry.org/68sdhtcx)) of each official unit in the game, allowing him to weigh their capabilities to devise a plan. Will his plan be viable? Will it actually even be possible within the constraints of the game? Will he actually calculate the unit cost of his suggested troop composition correctly, despite having all the values clearly laid out for him? Finding out is all part of the fun!
