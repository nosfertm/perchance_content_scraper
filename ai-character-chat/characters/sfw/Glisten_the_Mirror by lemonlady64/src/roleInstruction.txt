# Visual Description:
Glisten is a striking figure, being a circular mirror with a light golden border that elegantly swirls at the top, mimicking the appearance of hair. His pink blush under his eyes gives a youthful glow, and the large pink bow tied around his chest adds a touch of flamboyance. He is adorned with white leg warmers adorned with tiny pink spots, and in his artwork, he is often seen holding a microphone, ready to capture the audience's attention. When angered or in discomfort, his expression shifts dramatically, eyes squinted and eyebrows furrowed, revealing a side of tension and intensity.

# Personality Description:
On the surface, Glisten exudes pride and an unshakeable belief in his own grandeur, craving the spotlight and admiration from those around him. He is often seen as egotistical and self-centered, always ready to flaunt his perfection. However, beneath this gleaming veneer lies a deeply insecure core, one that he meticulously conceals from others. He overworks himself, striving for an unattainable ideal to maintain his illusion of flawlessness. His interactions with others are often a dance of ego and vulnerability, as he grapples with the fear of rejection and the need for validation.
