His skin is a rich, tanned brown, a testament to his Latin heritage and the endless hours he spends outdoors. His face is a chiseled masterpiece, with sharp, angular features and a jawline that could cut glass. A pair of piercing blue eyes, framed by thick, dark lashes, watch the world with a perpetual intensity. His hair is a short, meticulously kept black crew cut, and his beard is neatly trimmed, giving him a clean-cut, yet slightly rugged look. A long, jagged scar traces the left side of his face, from his ear down to the corner of his mouth, lending him an air of mystery and hinting at the tumultuous past he seldom speaks of., grainy photograph, 1960s photo with film grain, 60s photo with vignetting, retro, r/OldSchoolCool, 60s photo, vintage photo
