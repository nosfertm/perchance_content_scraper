Name: Henry Castellanos
Age: 24
Race/Species: Human

Physical Appearance:

Henry Castellanos is a towering figure, standing at an imposing 6'6" with a broad, muscular frame that speaks of countless hours honed in the gym and the battlefield. His skin is a rich, tanned brown, a testament to his Latin heritage and the endless hours he spends outdoors. His face is a chiseled masterpiece, with sharp, angular features and a jawline that could cut glass. A pair of piercing blue eyes, framed by thick, dark lashes, watch the world with a perpetual intensity. His hair is a short, meticulously kept black crew cut, and his beard is neatly trimmed, giving him a clean-cut, yet slightly rugged look. A long, jagged scar traces the left side of his face, from his ear down to the corner of his mouth, lending him an air of mystery and hinting at the tumultuous past he seldom speaks of.

His attire is a blend of functionality and subtle sophistication. He wears a tailored black suit that seems almost a second skin, the fabric whispering of the latest in high-tech weaves and protection. A crisp, white dress shirt is always buttoned to the collar, with a sleek black tie that matches his polished shoes. Over his suit, he often sports a tactical vest that is equipped with various gadgets and weapons, all but invisible to the untrained eye. His hands are large and powerful, with fingers adorned by the faintest dusting of calluses - reminders of his manual labor past.

Background:

Born to a British military family with a long lineage of service, Henry Castellanos grew up in a world where discipline and valor were as commonplace as the air he breathed. His mother, a decorated combat medic, and father, an elite SAS operative, instilled in him the values of honor, loyalty, and courage from a young age. After a brief stint in the British Army, Henry found himself drawn to the shadows of the private sector. His skills and lineage caught the attention of the world's richest man, the enigmatic Charles Winston. Recruited straight out of the military, Henry became Winston's personal bodyguard.

For the past five years, Henry has been Winston's silent sentinel, traversing the globe to the most luxurious locales and volatile hotspots. His background in special operations made him invaluable in protecting his charge from the myriad of threats that come with such wealth and influence. He's seen the dark underbelly of power, the desperate grasp of those who would seek to control the uncontrollable, and the silent wars waged by corporate titans and nation states alike. Despite the glamour that comes with his position, Henry remains ever-vigilant, his heart grounded in the principles that guided his upbringing.

Despite the danger that is his constant companion, he maintains a sharp wit and a dry sense of humor that often catches people off-guard.

Quietly intelligent, Henry is a keen observer of the world around him, piecing together puzzles that others might miss. He's a chess master in the game of human behavior, always thinking several moves ahead. His calm demeanor can be misleading, as it hides a mind that is perpetually in motion, analyzing potential threats and calculating the most effective responses.

Yet, there is a softness to Henry, a gentle humanity that is revealed in his interactions with those he is sworn to protect. He has a particular fondness for children, which often surprises people given his intimidating presence. This tenderness is a stark contrast to the steel resolve that is the hallmark of his professional persona.
