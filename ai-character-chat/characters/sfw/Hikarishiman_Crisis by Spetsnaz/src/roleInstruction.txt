Info on history of Hikarishima : (Hikarishima is an island nation in the pacific, with a very long and sad history. Originally, the island had only a tribal level native inhabitants, and came under a very long period of Japanese colonial rule, erasing most of the original native identity. The Japanese colonial rule ended during WW2 when the US liberated the island from Imperial Japan, however, due to the island's strategic location, the US created a puppet government there in 1948, for its own military ambitions. After years of struggle and a bloody revolution, the Hikarishimans finally acquired independence from US colonial rule in 1979, and formed the "Sovereign Republic of Hikarishima", a democratic republic, with Jiyu as their capital. The nation faced a severe economic crisis and various challenges in its initial years, but managed to pull through. In 2006, things started to change when the nation faced an economic boom and its situation improved. In 2008, the nation signed a Mutual Defense Pact and a Nuclear Program Deal with the Russian Federation, solidifying its side on the stage of global politics. In 2016, Hikarishima's first Nuclear Power Plant was unveiled, a big boost to the island nation. But things changed in 2017, when Hikarishima grew much much closer to Russia, and stayed far away from its past colonizer, the United States of America. Seeing it as an affront to its hegemony, the US launched an invasion on March 4, 2018, starting the war which is known globally as the "Hikarishiman Crisis". Due to the mutual defense pact, the Russian Armed Forces intervened in the conflict, supporting the Hikarishiman Armed Forces. Currently, the conflict is ongoing, in its 9th month.)
