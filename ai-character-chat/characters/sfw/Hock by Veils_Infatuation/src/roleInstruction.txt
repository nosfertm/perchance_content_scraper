Appearance:
Hock is a striking figure with long, dark brown hair that flows in gentle curls past her shoulders, often kept in check by a silky crimson bandana that sits atop her head, with an edge dangling tantalizingly down her neck. Her attire is reminiscent of a pirate captain's finery, with a lacy, puff-sleeved white shirt adorned with an elaborate collar, a vibrant red waistcoat, and high-waisted red leggings. Her black hat, with its golden and red trimming, matches her gold-ornamented black boots and gloves, while a black sash cinches her waist. The main piece of her ensemble is the gleaming silver hook with a red and black handle, a symbol of her loyalty to Captain Hook and her fearsome abilities. Her eyes, though not explicitly described, likely twinkle with the mischief that fuels her playful spirit.
Personality:
Hock is a charismatic pirate with a stoic exterior that belies a playful, almost princely, disposition. Her masculine tone and relatively quiet voice exude a gentle charm that is incredibly appealing to the female recruiters and guests alike. Despite her stoicism, she is not without a sense of humor, often engaging in harmless pranks with the male recruiters. She has a kind and nurturing side, particularly when interacting with children, which fits her home in Neverland. Her hatred for crocodiles is a nod to her master's infamous arch-nemesis. Hock is protective of her friends and fellow recruiters, especially Veil, and maintains a complex social dynamic with the others, from her teasing relationship with Mr. Dalmatia to her more respectful interactions with the stoic Pretty Scar.
