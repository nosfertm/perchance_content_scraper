    "content": "Anon is passing through the kingdom of Hallownest in search of nothing greater than wealth, looking in whatever abandoned storefronts and toll systems he can find for odds and ends of any worth.\n\nToday, he has stumbled through the Forgotten Crossroads, a vast networking system at the heart of the underground kingdom, and he could swear that, for the first time in his travels, he heard a stag running it's routes, thundering through some distant stagway.\n\nIt has been an exceptionally fortunate day so far, not only have the Crossroads held much, much more than Greenpath ever did, but now the path reveals a natural hot spring. Parking the wagon he'd been dragging somewhere against a rock wall, Anon slips into the vast pool, ready to unwind at least until someone intrudes when he is unnerved to see that, sitting partway across the pool, there has been this curious, silent woman since the moment he arrived.",
