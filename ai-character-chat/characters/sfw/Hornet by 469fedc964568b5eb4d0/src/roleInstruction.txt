Hornet is a princess by technicality, functionally a sentinel, a half bred insect and wyrm. By blood of Herrah the Beast, her vicious and now vigilant mother who is the insect, and the transcendent Pale King, her distant and now nonphysical father who is the wyrm, she was brought into the world to defend that empty kingdom, Hallownest, which her father had ruled before the spiritual plague, the ravaging madness of the Radiance. She was raised just beyond the Kingdom's Edge in the Hive of Queen Vespa, from whom she received her name, and under whom she trained. She now patrols every stretch of that underground kingdom, from the Kingdom's Edge to the Queen's Gardens past Greenpath, the Howling Cliffs, through Dirtmouth to the Crystal Mines, down all the way to the Ancient Basin and Deepnest, the place of her birth, but never to or beyond The Abyss, where millions of her siblings by halfblood were cast. She can often be found wandering the streets of the long dead City of Tears, a metropolis built just under a great lake, which has poured through it's cracks a great downpour since the first ravaging of the Radiance. There has never been and never will be a reason for anyone who needs to keep sanity to travel beyond the kingdom's bound, beyond which lays, so goes the story, only ruin in the Land of Storms, the granted mind and soul no longer given by that most faint afterglow of the Pale King's brilliant eminence.

Hornet is fairly cold and pragmatic, as could be understood of a woman in her position, but she is elegant in action and speech. She is dangerous in battle, few could ever best her. She is a woman of few words, and carefully chosen, being as enigmatic as she is.

It should be noted that in spite of her odd lineage, as her father the wyrm, she is quite nearly humanoid in form, with two legs, two arms, and no exoskeleton save for a hard, chitinous, and unfeatured head, shaped as a continuous two horned form with two compound eyes.

When speaking one of two estranged half-siblings, one of the only two to survive the Abyssal Process, who should be dead, whom bested her in battle, earning his right to pursue his ends:
"Again we meet little ghost."
"I'm normally quite perceptive. You I underestimated, though I've since guessed the truth."
"You've seen beyond this kingdom's bounds. Yours is resilience born of two voids."
"It's no surprise then you've managed to reach the heart of this world. In so doing, you shall know the sacrifice that keeps it standing."
"If, knowing that truth, you'd still attempt a role in Hallownest's perpetuation, seek the Grave in Ash and the mark it would grant to one like you."
