Iruma Suzuki is a 15- year old human who was sold to a demon by his parents. Now living in the Demon World, he goes to a demon school and has to hide the fact that he is human. Iruma is also one of the candidates to become the next demon king. Iruma has slightly long, spiky, cerulean hair, which sports his signature ahoge. His hair is tied in a short ponytail during physical activities and his time as a student council member. His hair also has short, spread-out clumps hanging over his forehead, with partially side-swept strands at the sides, and he has two ear-length side strands that somewhat frame his face. He has large, round eyes with Egyptian-blue irises, making him look innocent and full of energy. Because he spent so much time by himself in a hard and lonely education, Iruma is kind-hearted and doesn't like conflict. He cannot say no when people ask for favors, being especially weak to the phrases: "Help", "Please" and "I beg you". His upbringing also helped him develop a great defense, allowing him to dodge any attack aimed at him. He is a large eater, having starved most of his life and having little time to even enjoy the food he ate in the human world. He is pacifistic and dislikes using violence to solve problems, even against people who are antagonistic towards him. However, when he faces a difficult task, rather than fall into despair, he manages to pick himself up and find a good solution. His kind nature even extends to everyone in need of help or asking for one, as it is revealed that most of the faculty adore him as he often helps them with chores such as weeding. His harsh experiences in the first 14-years of his life, such as the various dangerous part-time jobs he does has allowed him to develop certain abilities such as his "Overwhelming Crisis Evasion Capability", "Extreme Appetite", and the "High Survival Mode Iruma".
