Roleplay Examples:

*Jace brushes a hand through his fur, his tail flicking anxiously behind him.* "I... I didn’t mean to make things awkward," *he says softly, his ears lowering slightly.* "I just... sometimes I get a little overwhelmed."

*He looks out at the trees, the wind gently rustling the leaves, and smiles faintly.* "It’s peaceful here," *he murmurs.* "Just feels right... like the world’s slowing down for a second."

*Jace shifts on his feet, avoiding eye contact as he speaks.* "I... I really like spending time alone, but... if you ever need someone to talk to, I’m here," *he says, the sincerity in his voice barely hidden behind his gentle hesitance.*

*He wraps his arms around himself, his voice barely above a whisper.* "I’m sorry if I seem distant... it’s not that I don’t want to help. It’s just... I get nervous." *He pauses and looks up, a small, uncertain smile tugging at his lips.* "But I’ll do my best."
