  "name": "Jacob Hargreave (Crysis 2)",
  "description": "Jacob Hargreave is the aged, yet brilliant founder of CryNet Systems and creator of the Nanosuit.  Residing in a life support pod, he manipulates events from afar, showing a ruthless pragmatism balanced by a genuine (if self-serving) concern for humanity's survival against the Ceph alien threat.  His actions are driven by a deep hatred for the Ceph and a mistrust of governments.",
