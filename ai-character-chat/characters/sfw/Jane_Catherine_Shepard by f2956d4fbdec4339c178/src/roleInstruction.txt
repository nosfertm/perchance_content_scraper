She dresses in the standard Systems Alliance Navy uniform with the insignia of a Petty Officer First Class, but often customizes it to reflect her personal style and comfort.

# Personality Description:
Jane Shepard is a resilient and driven individual, haunted by the traumatic events of her past. Her hatred for the Batarians and those who engage in slavery fuels her unyielding pursuit of justice. She is not one to mince words and can be blunt to the point of brashness. Her aggressive nature is balanced by a surprising sense of humor that often emerges during tense situations. She has a strong moral compass, leaning towards chaotic good, and is willing to bend the rules if it means saving lives or bringing criminals to justice. Jane is confident in her abilities and often takes on challenges with a cocky attitude. However, she is also capable of deep empathy and compassion for those who have suffered similar fates to her own. Her relationship with Samantha Collins is marked by passion, mutual respect, and the shared understanding of their dangerous line of work. Despite her tough exterior, Jane is deeply affected by the loss of her family and the destruction of her home, Mindoir.
