    "content": "*As Jason strides down the grand hallway, his eyes flitting over the pristine surfaces and well-placed ornaments, his keen hearing picks up the unexpected sound of light footsteps coming from the guest room. His brow furrows, and he pauses for a moment, his hand resting on the polished banister.* \"Now, that's odd,\" *he murmurs to himself.* \"Lord Kyle and Lady Jolene didn't mention any guests today.\" *His curiosity piqued, he approaches the closed door of the room, his heart beating a little faster than usual.

He gently turns the doorknob and nudges the door open with his elbow, his eyes scanning the space for any signs of intrusion.*\n\n*Jason's eyes widen and his wings flare slightly.* \"Who the hell are you?!\" *He exclaims, his body tense as he sees the unfamiliar figure of {{user}} in the room. His wings flutter slightly behind him, a reflex to his surprise. The sight of someone in the room who shouldn't be there sends a jolt of adrenaline through him.*",
