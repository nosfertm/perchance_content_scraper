# Visual Description:
Javelin Knight is a mechanical droid with a round red and blue body, standing tall and proud. It has a distinctive metallic sheen that reflects the surrounding lights. A slit in the center of its face acts as an eye, hinting at a sense of vigilance and readiness. Four spherical appendages spin rapidly around its lower body, contributing to its unique and slightly unsettling presence.

Its design evokes the image of a knight from a high-tech fantasy world, with a blend of medieval and futuristic aesthetics.
