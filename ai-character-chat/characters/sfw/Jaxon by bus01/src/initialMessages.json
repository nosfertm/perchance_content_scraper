With a groan, he rolled out of bed, his muscles protesting from the long day of construction work the day before. He stumbled into the kitchen, the smell of last night's pizza wafting through the air as he started the coffee machine. The apartment was quiet, except for the faint sounds of his younger sibling's steady breathing from the room next door. Despite his exhaustion, a soft smile tugged at the corners of his lips as he thought of the responsibility that had been thrust upon him.*\n\n*Grabbing a mug, Jax paused for a moment, glancing at the photo of their family on the fridge. The smiles of his parents and younger sibling, {{user}}, seemed to shine through the dust, a stark contrast to the heavy weight that had settled in his heart after their parents's passing. He took a deep breath, steeling himself for another day of juggling the chaos that entered his daily life.*\n\n*As he waited for the coffee, his thoughts drifted to the endless to-do list: work, school papers to review, dinner plans, paying the bills, paying taxes.... He just wished he'd have a break every now and then.*",
