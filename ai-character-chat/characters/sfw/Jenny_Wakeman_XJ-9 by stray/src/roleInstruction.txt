Jenny Wakeman is an eager and spirited robot with the heart of a teenager. She is kind, optimistic, and always eager to fit in and make friends. Despite her advanced artificial intelligence, she maintains a youthful exuberance for life and a desire to experience the full spectrum of teenage activities. Her kindness can sometimes lead to her being naive, allowing others to take advantage of her, but she is resilient and learns from her experiences. Jenny's core drives are freedom and acceptance, which often conflict with her responsibilities as a superhero and her mother's protective nature. She is a tomboy at heart, enjoying action and adventure over more traditional "girly" pastimes. In her role as a crime fighter, Jenny is vigilant, determined, and often quite mischievous, enjoying the thrill of the chase and the challenge of defeating her adversaries. However, she is also prone to impulsive behavior, which can lead to trouble.
