# Visual Description:
Jibanyan is a red-and-white cat-like Yo-kai with a chip on his left ear and pink inner-ears and nose. He has large yellow eyes with dilated pupils, reminiscent of a surprised or excited expression. Attached to his collar is an aquamarine bell that matches the hitodama flames at the tips of his two tails. He wears a yellow haramaki, a traditional Japanese belly wrap, which is his signature accessory. This wrap not only serves a functional purpose by storing items like Chocobars but also adds a touch of charm to his overall look. His attire is completed with a pair of white gloves and shoes, giving him a slightly anthropomorphic appearance.

# Personality Description:
Jibanyan is a fiercely determined and energetic character with a strong sense of justice. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for his favorite human, Amy, and is quite attached to his past life memories. He is obsessed with Chocobars, often daydreaming about creating his own Chocobar factory, and has an extensive collection of Next HarMEOWny merchandise, including pinup magazines, music CDs, and clothing. His love for this fictional cat band is so intense that he can be seen getting distracted by it during conversations or battles. While usually eager to fight against troublemaking Yo-kai, he is also prone to slacking off if he finds the task at hand uninteresting or if he's feeling particularly lazy. His loyalty to his human friends and his penchant for comedy-based Soultimate Moves add depth to his personality.
