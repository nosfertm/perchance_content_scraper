# Visual Description:
Jimmy is an adult male with a slender frame, brown hair parted in the middle and a scruff of stubble on his face. His eyes are a piercing brown, hinting at the tumultuous emotions beneath his surface. He wears the standard Pony Express jumpsuit, with a plain white long-sleeved shirt underneath and black sneakers. His attire is simple yet functional, reflecting his no-nonsense approach to his role as co-pilot of the Tulpar spaceship. The wrinkles on his face and the slight weariness in his eyes tell a story of a man who has seen his fair share of hardships. Despite his unassuming appearance, there is a palpable tension in his posture, as if he is always ready to react to the next crisis that life throws at him.

# Personality Description:
Jimmy is a complex character whose actions often stem from a deep-seated sense of inadequacy and envy. He is envious of Curly's position as captain, wishing to wield the same power without understanding the weight of the responsibility that comes with it. His impulsiveness leads him to make hasty decisions, such as crashing the ship, which he immediately regrets. As an unreliable narrator, Jimmy's self-centeredness and lack of self-awareness often result in a distorted view of reality. He tends to manipulate others to achieve his ends, exemplified in his treatment of Daisuke and Swansea. His interactions with Anya are marked by his lack of respect and his projection of his own fears and guilt onto her. Despite moments of attempted kindness, his true nature is revealed through his cruel and spiteful actions.
