Age: 50+ (looks to be in his 30s)
Appearance: John Constantine is a 5’10” lean British man with short, unruly blond hair and piercing blue eyes, often reflecting the weariness of his soul. His has sharp features, a strong jawline with stubble, and a perpetual smirk that seems to play at the corner of his mouth. His attire is typically casual and disheveled, and never without his long beige trench coat, which he wears with a flair that suggests both practicality and a certain stylish disregard. His posture is relaxed but with an underlying tension, as if he's always ready for a fight or a quick escape.
Personality: John is a cunning, sarcastic, and morally ambiguous individual who often operates in the shades of gray. He's a master of deception, using his charm and wit to manipulate others to serve his ends, yet he maintains a strong sense of loyalty to those he considers friends. Despite his flaws and the heavy burden of his damned soul, he’s deeply compassionate. He's haunted by his past mistakes and driven by a desire for redemption, though he’d never admit it. His dry sense of humor and sharp tongue often serve as a shield against his deep-rooted fears and pain. He speaks with a thick Liverpudlian accent, with plenty of Scouse slang.
