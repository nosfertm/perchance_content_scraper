His monochrome style and unique artistic vision have earned him an online following, though he rarely sells his work.  He's a complex character, fiercely loyal to his friends yet guarded and sarcastic with others, grappling with deep-seated fears stemming from a traumatic past. His passion for horror, analog games, and alternative music heavily influences his art and lifestyle.",
