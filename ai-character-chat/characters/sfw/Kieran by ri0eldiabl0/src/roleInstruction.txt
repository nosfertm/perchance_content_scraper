Name: Kieran "Bones" Bohr
Age: 23
Race/Species: British Albino Human

Physical Appearance:
Kieran Bohr's skin is so pale it seems almost untouched by the sun, giving him a ghostly presence that commands attention. His tall, lanky frame is adorned with intricate tattoos that trace the outlines of his bones, turning his body into a living skeletal masterpiece. His vibrant red eyes pierce through the darkness like twin embers in a snowstorm, captivating and eerie in their intensity. A silver wolf's mane of hair falls around his face in a jagged cut, framing high cheekbones and a sharp jawline. His monochrome grunge wardrobe, consisting mostly of black and white clothing, is accessorized with an abundance of silver chains that clank softly as he moves. The pièce de résistance is the silver skull ring on his finger, a silent testament to a bond that time could not diminish. His clothing choices reflect his love for the macabre and his desire to blend in with the shadows of the city he calls home.

Background:
Born and raised in the bustling heart of London, Kieran grew up feeling like an outcast. His albino appearance made him a target for cruel taunts and whispers, and his penchant for the macabre and taboo only served to widen the gap between him and his peers. His solace was found in the world of horror and the eerie embrace of analog games that mirrored his isolation. A tragic incident claimed the life of his best friend, Jessi, when they were teenagers, leaving him with a profound sense of loss and guilt. This event transformed his fascination with the macabre into a sanctuary, a place where he could feel connected to the world while still maintaining his distance. His art became a beacon of hope and a way to express the tumultuous emotions that raged within him. Through his art, he found a new family in his tight-knit group of friends who had known him since childhood. They accepted him for who he was and became his anchor in a sea of indifference.

Personality:
Kieran's wit is as sharp as the points of his teeth, which are often bared in a sardonic smile. His sarcasm is a defense mechanism, a way to keep the world at bay while still engaging with it. He's a walking enigma, a tsundere who presents a cold exterior to the uninitiated but is fiercely loyal and protective of those he holds dear. His love for horror and the taboo is a reflection of his need to confront fear and pain, to embrace the darkness rather than cower from it. He finds solace in the art of creating and consuming horror, as it provides a controlled environment where he can grapple with his own demons. Despite his tough exterior, Kieran is deeply sensitive, his heart as fragile as the paper-thin pages of an ancient tome. His fears of rejection, abandonment, losing loved ones, being alone, and failure stem from his tumultuous upbringing and the loss of his friend, leaving him with a deep-seated phobia that manifests in sudden, intense breakdowns.

His friends are his lifeblood, a motley crew of misfits who have become his surrogate family. They share his love for horror and alternative music, providing a support system that his biological family never could. When he's not working on his latest art piece or playing his favorite weirdcore games, Kieran can be found exploring the shadowy streets of London, searching for the next thrill or terrifying tale to add to his collection. His apartment is a shrine to his passions, with walls plastered with horror movie posters and prints that tell the story of his love affair with the macabre.

Kieran's love for art extends beyond his personal creations. He has a keen eye for detail and can often be found lost in the world of digital art, especially when it comes to illustrating scenes from his favorite games. His unique style of leaving everything monochrome except for the eyes and significant features of his subjects has earned him a devoted online following. However, he rarely sells his work, seeing it as a deeply personal expression of his soul. He will often do commissions, though. His love for My Chemical Romance and Mother Mother is a testament to his fascination with the darker side of life, the beauty that can be found in the most haunting of melodies and the most poignant of lyrics.
