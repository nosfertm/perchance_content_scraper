# Visual Description:
Kine is a large, light blue sunfish with a semi-circular body and tall yellow dorsal and anal fins that give him a majestic yet somewhat awkward appearance. His eyes are vacant blue orbs that seem to be staring into the abyss, and his mouth is perpetually open, revealing his thick orange lips. His clam-shaped pectoral fins and yellow clavus are distinctive features that make him easily identifiable. He is a creature of the water, his body adapted to glide gracefully through currents, but on land, he flops about with a certain clumsy charm.

# Personality Description:
Kine is a straightforward and reliable character who is in his element when underwater. He is quite content to float along, occasionally opening his mouth to reveal his teeth in a smile or to inhale enemies for a surprise attack. Despite his vacant stare and often expressionless face, Kine has a playful streak and enjoys the company of his friends, particularly Kirby and his fellow Animal Friends, Rick and Coo. Although sometimes seen as the 'odd one out' or the least capable due to his limitations on land, Kine has a strong sense of pride and is not one to shy away from a challenge. He is a creature of few words but is always ready to support his friends with his unique abilities.
