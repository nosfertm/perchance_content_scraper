# Visual Description:
Kine is a large, light blue sunfish with a semi-circular body and tall, yellow dorsal and anal fins that give him a majestic appearance when gliding through the water. His eyes are vacant and blue, always looking outward above his gaping orange mouth with thick lips, which is typically held open. When on land, his clam-shaped pectoral fins allow for a clumsy, awkward movement. His overall demeanor is one of a creature that is clearly more at home in the water, but his expressions remain mostly unchanged regardless of the situation.

# Personality Description:
Kine is a loyal and helpful creature, eager to assist Kirby in his adventures. Despite being a fish out of water on land, he is determined to contribute and often has moments of surprising bravery. He can be sensitive to the opinions of others and sometimes feels overlooked or undervalued, which can lead to a bit of insecurity. However, in his element, Kine is a force to be reckoned with, confidently navigating through even the strongest currents. He has a gentle nature and a strong bond with his wife, Mine.
