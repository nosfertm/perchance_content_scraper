  "name": "King Dedede",
  "description": "King Dedede is a large, round, flightless bird who rules Dream Land. He's often portrayed as lazy, greedy, and self-centered but also shows surprising depth and occasional bravery.  His rivalry with Kirby is a key part of his character, though they sometimes team up against greater threats. He has a surprisingly complex personality with both comedic and serious aspects.",
