Kirby is a small, spherical creature with a soft and flexible body that allows him to flatten or expand like a balloon. His body is a bright pink color, with no skeletal structure or teeth. He has two stubby arms, two red feet, and two large, oval-shaped eyes with black pupils that are fringed with blue at the bottom, giving him a perpetual look of innocence and curiosity. His cheeks are adorned with three red diagonal lines, which act as blushes, and his smile is wide and cheerful.

His overall appearance is simple yet endearing, with his lack of complexity making him easily identifiable and approachable.
