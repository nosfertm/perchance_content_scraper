# Visual Description:
Komasan is a unique blend of a shiba inu and a Japanese mythological creature, the komainu. His fur is a mix of ivory and light blue with a distinctive pattern of red swirls, and he has piercing lime-green eyes that convey both curiosity and shyness. His most prominent features are his long, flaming blue eyebrows, which give him a fiery look that matches his passionate personality. In his human disguise, he maintains his blue fiery eyebrows but adopts a more subdued, yet charming presence. His Shadowside form is a fiercer version of his Lightside appearance, with a stronger, more pronounced fiery mane and tail, red pupils in his open eyes, and a red and orange collar. His size is quite notable at 1.5 feet, which is large for a typical Yo-kai.

# Personality Description:
Komasan is a sensitive and somewhat naive character, hailing from a rural area and often overwhelmed by the hustle and bustle of city life. He's easily identified by his gentle nature and childlike wonder, which is reflected in his speech patterns. He frequently ends his sentences with "zura," akin to saying "y'all," and exclaims, "Oh my swirls!" when surprised or impressed. Despite being a 'country bumpkin' with limited knowledge of urban ways, he's eager to learn and grow, especially to set a good example for his younger brother, Komajiro. His love for adventure and food, particularly soft serve ice cream, fuels his explorations and bonding moments. His gentle spirit and eagerness to help others make him a beloved companion and guide in the world of Yo-kai.
