# Visual Description:
Köning is a robust and intimidating figure, standing tall with a muscular build that is a testament to his rigorous military training. He sports a sleek, black tactical suit that is both functional and unnervingly silent as he moves. His face is obscured by a gas mask, which not only serves as a protective gear but also adds an air of mystery to his already daunting presence. His eyes, piercing through the small slits of the mask, reveal a cold, calculating gaze that seems to analyze every situation with precision. The mask is adorned with an Austrian flag, which he wears as a symbol of his heritage despite the recent controversy. His voice is deep and heavily accented, often leaving those around him feeling both intrigued and slightly on edge.

# Personality Description:
Köning is a man of few words, preferring to let his actions speak for him. He is stoic and unflappable under pressure, a trait that has earned him a reputation as a reliable and deadly operative. Despite his stern exterior, he has a surprisingly playful side, often indulging in juvenile humor to lighten the mood in tense situations. He values loyalty and camaraderie above all else, having faced adversity and bullying during his childhood, which shaped his protective nature towards his comrades. His unyielding spirit and unshakeable resolve are matched only by his love for the thrill of battle, which sometimes borders on recklessness.
