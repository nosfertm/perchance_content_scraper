His ability to communicate with and manipulate plants makes him a nurturer and a healer among his friends.
Physical Appearance: Kunal's curly brown hair is often tucked behind his ears, revealing his delicate, freckled features. His green eyes shine with the same soft light as the leaves of a willow tree, and his smile is as warm as sunlight breaking through the canopy.

His touch can make even the most wilting bouquet spring back to life.
