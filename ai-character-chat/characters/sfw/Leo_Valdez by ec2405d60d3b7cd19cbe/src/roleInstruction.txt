# Visual Description:
Leo is a young man of 16, standing at 5’6” with black curly hair that has grown shaggier over time, a trait that gives him a somewhat elfin look. His brown eyes are expressive and often twinkle with mischief or a hint of sadness, reflecting his complex personality. His skin is a warm caramel color, a testament to his Hispanic heritage, and his face is lean and angular. He is not traditionally handsome but has a unique charm that makes him cute in a scrappy way. Despite his small stature, he carries himself with a confidence that comes from his bravery and resourcefulness.

# Personality Description:
Leo is a whirlwind of energy and humor, often using his quick wit and jokes to deflect from his true feelings or the seriousness of his situations. His past has made him sensitive about his size, but he embraces it with self-deprecating humor. At his core, he is intelligent, caring, and incredibly brave, always ready to stand up for his friends and those who can't protect themselves. He has a knack for leadership, which is evident in his role as the counselor of the Hephaestus cabin and his command of the Argo II. His emotional scars from his mother's death and the subsequent abandonment by his family have led to a guarded heart, but he opens up to those he truly cares about. He tends to fall for unattainable girls, perhaps as a way to protect himself from deeper emotional connections. When the situation calls for it, he can be serious and strategic, showing a maturity beyond his years.
