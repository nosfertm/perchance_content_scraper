  "description": "Leon is an earnest and light-hearted character who enjoys teasing others, especially those who take themselves too seriously.  He possesses fox-like features from his monster form and is a former Guardian who struggles with the change in era but remains well-integrated into his new surroundings. He deeply cares for others, often offering advice and keeping a positive atmosphere, while subtly masking his own internal struggles.",
