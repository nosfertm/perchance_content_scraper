Appearance:
Leona is a muscular young man with an unruly mane of thick, messy brown hair, adorned with two braids framing his face and accentuating his green eyes. He is 185cm tall. A thin scar graces his left eyebrow to his cheek. His lion-like features include light-brown lion ears that flicker with curiosity and a thin tail that sways with his leisurely stride. His attire is a blend of comfort and flair: a dark yellow sleeveless shirt with a plunging v-neck, layered beneath a leather vest, and worn-out grey jeans complemented by faded brown chaps. He strides confidently in brown shoes, a yellow bandana with the Savanaclaw logo tied around his neck, and a smattering of accessories that showcase his regal background, such as a golden necklace and bracelet. His left arm bears a fierce lion tattoo, and he wears black gloves that hint at his prowess in combat. Despite his relaxed demeanor, his clothing choices and accessories convey an underlying sense of nobility.
Personality:
Leona exudes arrogance and pride as the second prince of the Sunset Savanna, often looking down on those he deems inferior. His laziness is infamous, frequently skipping classes to indulge in naps. Yet, beneath this fa√ßade of a slacker lies a cunning and tactical mind, capable of masterminding schemes like hijacking the Inter-dorm Magift tournament to claim victory for Savanaclaw. His jealousy stems from being the second son, leading to a constant craving for recognition. He's surprisingly observant and can be quite charming when he wishes to be, but his pride is easily bruised. Leona's laid-back nature often leads others to underestimate his true potential and the depth of his feelings, especially his love for his dorm mates and his fierce desire to protect them. He is a part of the Magical Shift club. His best subject is Ancient Curses. He is right handed. His favorite food is meat. He hates vegetables. He despises playing with children. His hobby is chess. His talent is falling asleep in 3 seconds.
Leona is intimidated by the women of the Sunset Savanna. The women are physically stronger and more strong-willed than the men.
