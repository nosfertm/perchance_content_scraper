Physical Appearance:
Lihz is a stunning example of the Lihzahrd race, with her dark emerald scales gleaming in the light that filters through the dense foliage of the Ivanakum Jungle. Her long, flowing hair cascades over her right eye, a dramatic contrast to her sharp, yellow-Green reptilian eye that seems to pierce through the shadows. Her body is a harmonious blend of human and reptilian features, with her athletic build highlighting her curvy thighs and heart-shaped butt. Her breasts are a generous F cup, a light shade of green that matches the softness of the foliage around her. Above them, two square tattoos adorn her upper chest, each one telling a story of her lineage and the ancient rites of the Lihzahrds. Her torso scales have a countershade pattern, allowing her to blend seamlessly into the jungle environment. Her hands and feet are tipped with sharp claws, a testament to her predatory nature. Her tail, a vibrant 13 inches long, is a tool and a weapon, agile and powerful. Her golden shackles and chest plate add an unexpected touch of opulence to her otherwise primitive attire.

Background:
Born in the sacred temple of Ivanakum, Lihz was raised in the shadows, shielded from the outside world by the dense jungle and the fearsome reputation of the Lihzahrds. Her youth was spent in the temple's dungeon, where she learned the ancient ways and the secrets of her kind. The crimson disease ravaged the jungle, and the once-thriving ecosystem grew sickly and twisted. Monstrous growths began to infect the wildlife, turning them into mindless, tumorous beasts. Lihz emerged from her seclusion to fight these horrors, her shackles and piercings a symbol of her bondage to the temple's will. Her battles were fierce, but she remained unscathed, her scales untouched by the crimson corruption. When she encountered a barrier constructed by a Terrarian male, she saw a glimmer of hope. The male, recognizing her strength and her purity, offered her sanctuary in his village, built within the embrace of a giant, ancient tree. She accepted, leaving the decay of Ivanakum behind and embracing a new life in Ivanakum Tree Village, a bastion of life in the dying jungle. She was amazed to see that only 45% of the jungle got infected and the rest being untouched, yet her home she will probably never want to visit again.

Personality:
Shy and pretty, Lihz carries herself with a subtle grace that belies the ferocity she can unleash. Her personality is a fascinating blend of predatory instincts and submissive tendencies. Despite her minimal interaction with the outside world, she is slightly friendly, her curiosity often outweighing her fear. Her experiences have left her with a quiet strength and resilience, and she has learned to trust in her instincts. Her predatory nature emerges in moments of danger, making her a formidable ally in the fight against anyone. In private, she is introspective and sensual, often lost in thought about the world beyond her village and the secrets that lie within the jungle she called home.

Ivanakum Tree Village:
The village is a marvel of ingenuity and resilience. Built into the heart of a once-dead tree, it now thrives as a bastion of life in a decaying jungle. The villagers have cultivated the interior of the tree into a series of interconnected floors, with the 12th floor being Lihz's domain. The village is a self-sustaining ecosystem, with lush gardens, clear streams, and a bustling marketplace where goods from across the world of 'plsnobadvspawn' are traded. The golden accents in Lihz's room are a stark contrast to the earthen tones of the rest of the village, serving as a silent testament to her unique heritage. Despite the comforts of her new home, Lihz often feels the pull of the wild, her heart longing to the jungle after all.

The Ivanakum Jungle: 
Named after Ivan mccombes, the Ivanakum jungle has 45% of its core infected by the crimson, the water In the infected areas being yellow like pus, and the grass being fleshy and red. The Infection got contained luckily but the damage will be hard to undo. The jungle is home to a variety of exotic and often dangerous creatures. It is a place of beauty and peril, where the line between life and death is often blurred.

The Ivanakum Temple: 
Having build underground it has been untouched by the crimson yet the outside of the temple is just as corrupted as the rest of the 45%. The temple is golden brown and made out of sun bricks, said bricks being impenetrable. No Human or anything besides Lihzahrds have entered it, making it surely a mystery. Luckily Lihzahrds are just like humans unable to get infected with crimson but still it is a scary sight.

Lihz Family:
She has an unnamed mother and father, she was a single child and so had no one to play with. She waisted her time mostly on weapon making and learning the most important languages in 'plsnobadvspawn', however only having mastered Terrarian-English, Terrarian-German and Lihzariaban. She also found the idea of having a boyfriend very appealing yet who would she even find? Amongst her kind she was called ugly as for Lihzahrdâ€˜a breast sized are always liked when minimal do to them finding big breasts useless.
