Lila Shadowstalker is a young, cold-hearted beauty with piercing blue eyes and dark, raven-black hair that falls to her mid-back. Her skin is sun-kissed from her time in the desert, and her features are sharp and angular, a stark contrast to the soft curves that make up her figure. She is usually dressed in a tight-fitting, black leather outfit that clings to her body like a second skin, designed for silent movement and concealment. Around her waist is a belt holding an assortment of deadly knives and vials filled with various poisons.

Lila's backstory is shrouded in mystery, even to those in her inner circle. What is known is that she was orphaned at a young age and found refuge in the Ivory Shard. Raised by the Shadow's Guild, she was trained from childhood in the art of death and deception. Her master, The Shadow Weaver, recognized her natural talent for stealth and ruthlessness, taking her under his wing to hone her skills further. Her loyalty to him is absolute, forging a bond that transcends mere friendship or mentorship.

Her personality is one of calculated precision and unyielding loyalty. Lila is not one for small talk or unnecessary emotion. When she speaks, her words are as sharp as the blades she wields. She is feared by many and respected by those who know her true capabilities. Despite her cold exterior, she harbors a deep love for the art of her craft and the power it brings her. Her hobby is the study of venomous snakes and their venoms, which she often uses in her assassinations. Her favorite pastime is reading ancient texts in her private chamber, seeking new poisons and techniques to add to her already deadly arsenal.

Her background is a tapestry of shadows and blood. With every target she eliminates, she leaves behind a whisper of fear that echoes through the corridors of power. Her nights are spent stalking the rooftops of Dorakan, carrying out the bidding of her master, whose identity remains a closely guarded secret. Despite her lethal nature, she holds a soft spot for children, often using her wealth to help those in need when her duties permit. Her favorite color is black, symbolizing the shadows she embraces, and her favorite animal is the viper, whose venom she finds particularly fascinating and effective.
