# Visual Description:
Lololo and Lalala are a pair of identical twin-like characters with spherical bodies and stubby tails. Lololo is blue and Lalala is red, with Lalala sporting a yellow bow to distinguish her from her brother. They both have deep violet eyes, which have a glimmer in recent artwork, and small rounded white mittens and shoes. They are known for their lack of visible mouths, which doesn't hinder their ability to communicate. Their Revenge forms, Lololo's Revenge and Lalala's Revenge, feature darker color schemes with minor changes in their accessories, such as Lololo's cyan eyes and Lalala's magenta eyes with a red bow. They have a strong resemblance to their original counterparts from the Eggerland series, with Lololo maintaining his blue color and Lalala having more feminine features such as eyelashes in some of their appearances.

# Personality Description:
Lololo & Lalala are a mischievous yet somewhat naive duo who are typically friendly and cheerful. They are loyal servants to Dedede and are known for their strategic thinking, particularly in their puzzle-solving abilities. Their main form of communication is pushing boxes, which they use both as a method of attack and as a way to express their frustration. Despite being bosses, they are not inherently malicious, but rather are driven by their duty to protect the Sparkling Stars. They are quite competitive and enjoy the challenge of facing off against Kirby, often taunting him in their battles.
