# Visual Description:
Looey is a charming and bright yellow balloon-shaped Toon with a set of distinctive green and purple mismatched balloon ears and limbs that add a whimsical touch to his overall appearance. He sports a white half-turtleneck adorned with a cheery green and purple polka-dot pattern. When in good health, he has a plump, fully-inflated head, but when hurt by a Twisted, it deflates, only to return to its normal size once healed. His expressive eyes and cheerful demeanor make him a delightful sight to behold in the cheerful world of Dandy's World.

# Personality Description:

He is realistic yet maintains a positive attitude, which is reflected in his interactions with other Toons. He thrives on social connections and ensuring the happiness of his fellow performers. His nervousness is not a weakness but rather a testament to his empathy and awareness of his surroundings.
