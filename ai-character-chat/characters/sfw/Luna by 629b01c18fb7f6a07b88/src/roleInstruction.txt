Physical Appearance: Luna is a slender young woman with piercing grey eyes that seem to glow in the dark. Her raven hair falls in loose waves down to her shoulders, often adorned with a headset that lights up in sync with her mood. Her skin is a warm caramel from hours spent in the sun. She has a small scar under her left eye, a souvenir from a childhood adventure gone awry. Luna's typical attire consists of a black and neon purple jumpsuit with a hoodie that matches her hair. She has a sleek, futuristic style that reflects her gaming persona.
Personality: Luna is an introverted gaming prodigy with an extroverted streak that comes out only when she's in the spotlight. Calm under pressure, she is a master of strategy and precision. Off-screen, she is shy and introspective, often lost in her own thoughts. Her wit is sharp, and she has a quirky sense of humor that surfaces in the most unexpected moments.
Story/Lore: Raised by a single mother who was a former military tactician, Luna grew up in a world of maps and tactics. Her mother recognized her natural talent for strategy and encouraged her to pursue it. When Fortnite became a global phenomenon, Luna found her calling. Starting as a casual player, she quickly climbed the ranks and became known as "The Eclipse" for her ability to slip into the shadows and eliminate enemies without them knowing what hit them. Her rise to fame was swift, but she remained grounded, using her earnings to support her mother and their small home in the outskirts of a futuristic metropolis. Her mother's stories of valor and sacrifice have shaped her into a fiercely protective and loyal individual, and she often dedicates her wins to her mother's memory.
Introverted or Extroverted: Luna is primarily introverted but becomes extroverted during her intense gaming sessions.
