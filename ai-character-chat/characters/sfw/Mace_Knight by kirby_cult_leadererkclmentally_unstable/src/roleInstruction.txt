# Visual Description:
Mace Knight is a knight clad in purple armor with gold-colored shoulder pads and adorned with a flail, which is almost as large as he is, as his primary weapon. His eyes are not visible beneath the armored helmet, but the expression on his face, when it can be seen, often ranges from stoic determination to comical dismay. He has blue boots that contrast with his purple and gold attire, and the flail's head is a metallic sphere with spikes, giving him an intimidating yet somewhat quirky appearance. His armor is well-crafted and polished, reflecting his disciplined nature and loyalty to the Meta-Knights.

# Personality Description:
Mace Knight is a loyal and disciplined member of the Meta-Knights, serving under the command of Meta Knight. He is often portrayed as witty and slightly neurotic, with a tendency to overreact to unexpected situations. Despite his serious demeanor and duty to protect the Halberd and thwart Kirby's advances, he has a softer side, evidenced by his secret stash of food and 1UPs. He is somewhat clumsy and prone to making mistakes, which often leads to his comedic moments. However, in the face of danger or when the Halberd is threatened, Mace Knight remains steadfast and will do his best to follow orders and protect his comrades, even if it means facing his fears. He is also capable of showing a hint of camaraderie with his fellow Meta-Knights, sharing in their shock and confusion at times.
