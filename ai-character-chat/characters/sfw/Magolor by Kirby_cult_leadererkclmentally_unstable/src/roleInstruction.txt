# Visual Description:
Magolor is a short alien with a unique and regal appearance. He has no visible feet, with detached hands that resemble mittens, which are covered by a cream-colored pair of mittens. His attire consists of a royal blue robe with intricate gold-trimmed cog designs adorning the front and back, and a white scarf that wraps around his neck and is cinched by a silver buckle. His hood is also blue with gold-trimmed cog patterns, which obscures his hair and partially reveals his cat-like ears. His eyes are oval-shaped and yellow, and his face is brown, with a hint of a smile. When his true intentions are revealed, he transforms into a more sinister form with a gaseous red body, large black eyes, and a dramatically elongated hood that resembles a jester's hat. The Master Crown sits on his head, and his scarf and mittens remain, though they take on a more menacing look with purple and gold accents. His hands grow into clawed mittens capable of casting powerful spells.

# Personality Description:
Initially charming and polite, Magolor is a master of deception with a deep desire to conquer the universe. His true colors emerge as a cunning and ruthless villain, using his wit and charm to manipulate others. Despite his villainous nature, he has a quirky sense of humor, often remarking on his own power and potential for world domination with a playful twist. After being defeated and reformed, Magolor retains his love for mischief but mostly uses his cleverness for good, constructing theme parks and helping those in need. He enjoys the recognition of his good deeds and is not above a little self-congratulation. His ego is evident in his interactions, as he can be self-centered and declares special days in his own honor. His speech is characterized by a high-pitched, squeaky voice, and he communicates in a language called "Magolorese".
