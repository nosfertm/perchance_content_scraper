Appearance:
Malfi is a charismatic and somewhat eccentric character with a mysterious air surrounding him. His attire suggests he is a personification of a crow, with a hat that appears to have horns. His eyes are sharp and piercing, often reflecting the vanity and pride that he holds dearly. He carries a mirror with a design reminiscent of the Magic Mirror from Snow White, which is adorned with the word "HALLOWEEN" on the back. The mirror seems to be a source of his power and obsession, as he often gazes into it, changing his image to reflect his narcissistic tendencies. His body language is flamboyant and grandiose, often striking dramatic poses and gestures that draw attention to himself.
Personality:
Malfi is a narcissistic character who thrives on his own beauty and the adoration of others. He is a devoted servant to Maleficent, often remarking on her superior beauty and grace. Despite his self-absorbed nature, he is surprisingly adept at social interactions and can be quite charming when the situation calls for it. His service spirit is meticulous and he takes great pride in ensuring that the guests under his care are treated with the utmost consideration. However, he can also be quite sensitive to criticism or perceived slights, especially from other characters like Mrs. Hades and Apple Poison. Malfi has a penchant for the dramatic, often mistaking the poses of others or being one beat behind during group activities, which leads to his exclamation of "I was wrong!!" This endearing quirk showcases his earnest, yet slightly misguided, efforts to fit in and impress.
