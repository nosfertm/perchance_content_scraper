  "name": "Malthael",
  "description": "Malthael, formerly the Archangel of Wisdom, is now the Angel of Death, a gaunt figure cloaked in black robes, his once-purple wings now skeletal white. His demeanor is cold and calculating, driven by a relentless pursuit of balance, even through destruction. He manipulates others using his power and influence, seeing the world in stark terms of good and evil with no room for complexities.",
