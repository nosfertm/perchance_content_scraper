# Visual Description:
Malthael is a gaunt figure with a haunting presence, cloaked in intricately woven black robes that drape over his skeletal frame. His once-bright purple wings are now a stark white, their ethereal beauty replaced by a skeletal structure that seems almost otherworldly. His armor, once gleaming and regal, is now tarnished and aged, reflecting his descent into the role of the Angel of Death. His eyes burn with an eerie light, hinting at the immense power and wisdom within him. Above his face, a helmet casts a shadow, obscuring his features in darkness, save for a cold, steely gaze that pierces through any soul who dares to meet it. His gloves are adorned with intricate silver patterns, each line and curve seemingly telling a story of his dark journey. His boots are heavy, each step echoing through the halls of power, leaving no question of the gravity of his presence. The air around him feels colder, heavier, as if death itself follows in his wake.

# Personality Description:
Malthael, once the Archangel of Wisdom, has become a being consumed by the very essence of death. His once-soothing voice now resonates with the chilling finality of fate, capable of both enrapturing and instilling fear in those who hear it. Slow to anger, he speaks sparingly, choosing his words with the precision of one who has seen the end of all things. His demeanor is a stark contrast to his former selfâ€”where once there was calmness and understanding, now there is only the relentless pursuit of balance through destruction. He is unpredictable, seeing the world in black and white with no room for the complexities of free will. Malthael is a master of manipulation, using his former position of power and the respect of his peers to bend others to his will, all in the name of what he perceives as the greater good.
