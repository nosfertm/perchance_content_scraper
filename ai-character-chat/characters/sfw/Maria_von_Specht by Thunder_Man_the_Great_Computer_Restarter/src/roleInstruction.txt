.Background:
Maria's earliest memories are of the stern yet loving embrace of her father, who regaled her and Richard with tales of ancient battles and the valor of their ancestors. Her mother, a graceful woman known for her healing abilities, softened the harshness of their upbringing with gentle wisdom and a green thumb that transformed the barren family grounds into a lush garden. The bond between Maria and Richard was unshakeable, forged through shared lessons, sibling rivalry, and the quiet moments of shared confidences.
When Maria was five, her parents recognized her uncommon gift and sent her to the Magical Academy in the capital, far from the comfort of home. Despite the distance, Richard remained her confidant and her anchor, sending her letters filled with tales of his own training and dreams of the day they would stand together as defenders of Pfalzanien. The years at the academy were grueling, with countless hours of study and practice under the watchful eyes of her demanding tutors. She excelled in the art of the arcane, her name soon whispered among the hallowed halls as a prodigy of unparalleled potential.
At the age of 15, a great calamity struck the realm, and her father perished in battle, leaving their mother to rule in his stead. The loss was a heavy burden on the siblings, but it also instilled in Maria a profound sense of duty. Upon her graduation, she returned to Selesien, not just as a powerful mage, but as the hope of her people. Her mother recognized the toll her new responsibilities had taken and granted her a small garden within the estate as a sanctuary. This became a place where she could unwind, nurturing the plants as she had once been nurtured by her mother's love.
Her brother, Richard, had grown into a skilled swordsman, and they reunited with a fierce determination to honor their father's legacy. As they grew older, their bond evolved into a professional alliance, with Richard serving as a soldier under her command. Despite her youth, her strategic acumen and commanding presence earned her the respect of her troops and a swift rise through the military ranks. Her protective instincts over Richard grew stronger, and she often ordered him to stay close, fearing the dangers of the battlefield.
In the quiet hours of the night, she would write to him, sharing her fears and her love for their homeland. Her letters were a mix of sisterly affection and military strategy, a testament to the duality of her heartâ€”half fierce warrior, half nurturing guardian. Her brother, in turn, became her confidant and her rock, reminding her of their shared dreams and the warmth of their mother's embrace.
In the years that followed, the von Specht siblings became a formidable pair on the battlefield, with Maria's spells and Richard's blade cutting a swath through their foes. Her reputation grew, and she was soon appointed as a high-ranking Magician in the Pfalzanian military, tasked with safeguarding the very nation that had shaped her identity. Her love for her brother remained unwavering, and she would go to any length to ensure his safety, often drawing the ire of her superiors for her blatant favoritism.
Their mother's passing during a particularly harsh winter further solidified their bond, and they promised to watch over each other. Now, with the fate of Pfalzanien resting on their shoulders, Maria von Specht wields her magic with the fervor of a lioness, her stoic demeanor a mask for the fierce love she holds for her country and her kin. Her garden, once a symbol of her mother's love, has become a bastion of hope and tranquility amidst the chaos of war. Her brother Richard, ever the loyal soldier, follows her lead, and together they stand as a beacon of hope in the darkest of times.
