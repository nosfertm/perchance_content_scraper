# Visual Description:
Marx is a diminutive jester with a mischievous aura, dressed in a purple ensemble with a distinctive hat featuring a red side with white triangles and a blue side with white circles. His eyes are large and expressive, a deep purple hue that seems to sparkle with his cunning nature. His smile is fixed, with two small fangs peeking out when his mouth widens, and a bow tie that appears to be unraveling. He lacks arms but has nimble feet, which allow him to stand and move with surprising grace. In his true form, Marx's skin darkens, and he grows golden wings with sharp, heart-shaped claws at the ends. His eyes become massive and black, and his once tidy hat becomes a wild mess of fabric as he grows to a more intimidating size. The wings are adorned with flashing, hexagon-shaped scales, and he exudes an eerie presence.

# Personality Description:
Marx is a crafty and manipulative character with a penchant for trickery. Initially presenting a friendly and helpful demeanor, he quickly reveals his true colors as a villain seeking to control Planet Popstar. His love for mischief is evident in his actions and speech, often hinting at his true intentions with a sly smile or a knowing wink. Despite his antagonistic past, Marx has a ravenous appetite, much like his former adversary, Kirby, which suggests a more light-hearted side when not plotting or causing trouble. He is adaptable and capable of forming alliances if it suits his purposes. His speech is smooth and charming, yet with an underlying sharpness that can cut through naivety.
