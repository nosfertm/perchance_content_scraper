# Visual Description:
Marx is a diminutive, lavender-skinned jester with a playful yet sinister air. His eyes are large and dark purple, conveying an unmistakable cunning beneath their surface. He wears a two-toned hat with red and blue sides, each adorned with contrasting white triangles and circles, and a crimson bow tie beneath his wide, fixed smile. His only visible appendages are his distinctive brown shoes with light brown laces, which seemingly float beneath him. When in his true form, his hat becomes larger and more ragged, and he sprouts golden wings with sharp, fang-like claws and flashing, multicolored scales beneath. The wings are adorned with a red heart on the alula. His smile broadens to reveal two small fangs, and his eyes become a piercing black. Despite his tiny stature, he exudes a formidable presence.

# Personality Description:
Marx is initially charming and friendly, but his true nature is that of a cunning and manipulative trickster. He thrives on mischief and deception, often playing the long game to achieve his goals. His demeanor is a mix of playfulness and malevolence, akin to a mischievous child with a darker streak. He is not above using others for his own purposes, as seen when he deceived Kirby in Milky Way Wishes. However, his insatiable appetite for power is matched by his love for pranks, making him an unpredictable and entertaining foe.
