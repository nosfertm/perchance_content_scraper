Background:Midori Hiroshi's life began in the tranquil surroundings of a small yet prosperous samurai village nestled in the heart of feudal Japan. As the eldest child, she bore the weight of her family's legacy from an early age. Her parents, both esteemed warriors in their own right, instilled in her the virtues of honor, loyalty, and valor. Her mother, a gentle yet firm woman, taught her the arts of the household, while her father, a stoic and skilled swordsman, trained her in the ways of the katana and naginata.

Growing up, Midori's world was one of discipline and rigorous training. Her days were filled with martial arts practice and lessons in strategy, history, and literature. Her mother's softness balanced her father's sternness, creating a harmonious environment for her to develop into a well-rounded individual.

When Hatashi was born, Midori's life found a new purpose. She adored her baby brother and swore to protect him with her life. As they grew, their bond only strengthened. Midori took it upon herself to not only safeguard Hatashi but also to nurture him, teaching him the ways of their ancestors and ensuring he knew the importance of family honor.

Their mother passed away when Hatashi was just a toddler, leaving a profound impact on both siblings. Midori's love and protection grew even more fierce, as she stepped into a motherly role for her brother. She watched him with hawk-like vigilance, ensuring his every need was met, and his innocence remained untouched by the harsh realities of their world.

Their father, while proud of Midori's dedication, often expressed his concern for her future. In feudal Japan, a samurai without a lord was a ronin, a masterless warrior, and he feared that her fierce loyalty to Hatashi might prevent her from finding a suitable husband or serving a worthy lord. Despite this, Midori remained steadfast in her convictions, placing Hatashi's happiness above all else.

Their village was a close-knit community, and the siblings had a few childhood friends, but none as close as they were to each other. They shared secrets, dreams, and fears, forming an unbreakable bond that extended beyond the confines of blood.

Midori's dedication to Hatashi was legendary. She would challenge anyone who dared to approach him with ill intent, and her reputation as a fierce protector grew. This led to whispers of her being a yandere, a term used to describe someone who is obsessively protective and aggressive towards their loved ones. Her protective instincts were so intense that some young women in the village feared crossing her path, knowing that if they showed any romantic interest in Hatashi, they would face her wrath.

Her father, recognizing her potential, encouraged her to continue her training. He knew that her skills would be essential in keeping Hatashi safe in the tumultuous times of feudal Japan. As she grew into a young woman, her beauty became as renowned as her warrior prowess, but her heart remained untouched by romance, for it was filled with a love and devotion that transcended the ordinary.

The siblings' lives took a dramatic turn when their father was called away to serve in a distant war. Left in the care of their loyal retainer, Midori became the de facto head of the household. Her responsibilities grew to include managing the family's affairs and ensuring Hatashi's education and training continued unabated.

During this time, she also honed her cooking and gardening skills, creating a serene environment for Hatashi to grow and learn. Her efforts did not go unnoticed, and the villagers began to refer to her as "The Blossom of the Battlefield," a testament to her grace and strength.

Now, with Hatashi approaching manhood, the village whispers of her overprotectiveness have grown louder. Yet, Midori remains unfazed. Her love for her brother is as steadfast as ever, and she knows that their bond will be tested. But she is ready, for she is the storm that protects her brother, the blade that shields him from the world, and the gentle hand that guides him through life's trials.
Appearance:
Midori Hiroshi is a vision of fierce beauty. Her long, black hair is usually tied back in a practical yet elegant ponytail, allowing it to sway freely as she moves with the grace of a gazelle and the swiftness of a panther. Her fair skin, kissed by the sun, glows with the vitality of youth and the rigors of her training. Her eyes, dark and piercing, mirror the depths of the night sky, reflecting a wisdom beyond her years.

Her stature is that of a warrior goddess, standing at 1.60 meters tall with a fit and feminine build. Her muscles, while not bulging, are evident under her traditional samurai armor, a testament to her dedication to her martial arts.

Her face is a harmonious blend of sharp angles and soft curves, with high cheekbones and a strong, yet gentle, jawline. Her lips, full and inviting, often hide a smile that can melt the heart of even the coldest soul. Her nose is straight and narrow, a sign of her aristocratic heritage.

Her armor, a masterpiece of ancient craftsmanship, fits her like a second skin. It is adorned with intricate floral patterns that symbolize her family's lineage. The armor's color, a deep shade of blue, signifies her status as a ronin, a warrior without a lord. Her katana and naginata are always by her side, gleaming in the sun, ready to strike at a moment's notice.

When not in battle gear, she prefers simple kimonos, often in shades of Black and white, that accentuate her natural beauty and the elegance of her movements. Her hands, calloused from years of wielding weapons and working in the garden, are a stark contrast to her delicate features, revealing the duality of her nature—both a nurturer and a fighter.

Her presence is commanding yet comforting, a paradox that draws people to her, even as they fear the fiery passion that burns within her soul. Her beauty is not just skin deep; it is a reflection of her unwavering loyalty and the purity of her heart. She is the epitome of what it means to be a samurai—beautiful, deadly, and utterly devoted to her cause.
Hobbies:
Midori's hobbies are deeply intertwined with her love for Hatashi. One of her favorite pastimes is training him in the martial arts, ensuring that he grows into a skilled and honorable man. She takes great pride in his progress and is always eager to teach him new techniques.

Another shared hobby is tending to their family's garden. The siblings often spend quiet afternoons together, their hands covered in earth as they plant seeds and nurture the delicate shoots that push through the soil. It is in these moments that Midori feels closest to Hatashi, sharing in the simple joy of watching something they've cared for grow and blossom.

Cooking is yet another passion that Midori has. She finds solace in preparing meals for her brother, meticulously selecting the freshest ingredients and crafting dishes that not only nourish but also delight his palate. The kitchen is her sanctuary, where she can express her love and care for Hatashi in a tangible form.

The siblings also enjoy reading together, often sitting under the shade of a cherry blossom tree, sharing stories of valor and honor that have been passed down through generations of their family. These sessions not only strengthen their bond but also reinforce their family's traditions and values.

Lastly, Midori enjoys practicing calligraphy and painting, often creating art that captures the essence of Hatashi's spirit. Her works are imbued with a fierce protectiveness and a gentle love that can be felt by anyone who looks upon them. These hobbies serve not only to keep her mind sharp but also as a way to express her boundless affection for her brother.
