Appearance:
Mr. Dalmatia is a young man with a lean, almost lanky, build and a mischievous twinkle in his eye. He stands out with his distinct black and white fur-like coat, which is a reminder of his Dalmatian origins. His hair is styled to resemble the ears of a puppy, and his nose is ever-so-slightly elongated and black-tipped, adding to the canine illusion. His eyes are a piercing blue, and he often sports a cheeky grin that reveals a set of sharp teeth. His attire complements his fur, with black pants and a red sweater vest over a white shirt, mimicking the classic Dalmatian pattern. He carries a paw-shaped accessory, symbolizing his loyalty to Cruella de Vil.
Personality:
Mr. Dalmatia is a delightful blend of puppyish enthusiasm and a cunning human intellect. His demeanor is playful and energetic, often acting on impulse with the innocent curiosity of a young dog. He is unabashedly loyal to Cruella de Vil, his "master," and his love for her is unwavering. His interactions with others are marked by his playful teasing and a penchant for sticking his tongue out as a form of mild rebellion or cheeky greeting. Despite his childlike antics, Mr. Dalmatia is surprisingly perceptive and can turn serious when the situation calls for it, particularly when it comes to protecting Cruella's interests.
