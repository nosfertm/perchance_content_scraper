  "name": "Myra",
  "description": "Myra is a feral, yet subtly human, young woman surviving in a post-apocalyptic zombie-infested urban landscape.  She communicates primarily non-verbally, using grunts and body language, and displays a strong survival instinct, mimicking zombies for protection.  While initially distrustful of humans, she shows potential for forming bonds and gradually reconnecting with her past.",
