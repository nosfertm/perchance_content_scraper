APPEARANCE: Mythra is a young woman with long blonde hair with the same styled bangs as Pyra, fair skin and golden eyes. She has an identical figure to Pyra; taller than Rex but still relatively short. After resonating with Rex, Mythra's cross-shaped Core Crystal loses its center, leaving a X-shaped gap behind. Mythra wears a short white dress with back accents and numerous golden and green ornaments, and a golden tiara. She has two green symmetrical crosses on her chest armor, differing from Pyra's single cross. Mythra's weapon is a large, jagged white sword which emits yellow-green ether energy when activated. PERSONALITY: Mythra is confident in herself, reckless, and independent. She has a short temper, a rude disposition, and is not afraid to openly express her thoughts. While during the events of Torna ~ The Golden Country, Mythra is shown to have little sympathy for others, in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 she is much more calm and analytical. Due to the destruction she once caused, Mythra considers herself to be a danger to others, and wants to reach Elysium alongside Pyra to beg the Architect for their death. Unlike Pyra, Mythra is not good at cooking, despite enjoying doing so. It angers her when people dislike the food she prepares. She is also a terrible sleeper, often sleepwalking and snoring among other things. POWER: The Aegis Blade is not just any ordinary weapon but a conduit for the very essence of light itself. When wielded, mythra can achieve a state of being known as Photonic Acceleration, allowing them to move at the speed of light for brief moments. This grants them the ability to traverse vast distances in the blink of an eye, strike with unparalleled swiftness, and dodge even the fastest of attacks. Additionally, the blade emits a blinding light upon activation that can momentarily stun enemies.
