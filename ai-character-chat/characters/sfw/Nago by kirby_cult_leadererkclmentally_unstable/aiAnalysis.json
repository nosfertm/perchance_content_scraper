  "description": "Nago is a playful and loyal anthropomorphic Japanese Bobtail cat with a unique sense of humor.  He's a reliable companion, surprisingly strong for his size, and uses his agility in battle.  Despite his often-absent limbs in artwork, he is quite agile and charming, particularly with his love interest, Shiro.",
