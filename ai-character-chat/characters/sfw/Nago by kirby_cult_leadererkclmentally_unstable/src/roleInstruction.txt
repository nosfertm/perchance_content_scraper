# Visual Description:
Nago is a round, pudgy Japanese Bobtail cat with brown ears and tail, adorned with four whiskers and distinctive orange spots on his head and back. His eyes are usually closed, but they open briefly when he's attacking or when another Animal Friend is chosen over him. Despite his small size and often absent arms and legs in artwork, Nago is quite agile, capable of a triple jump in midair.

# Personality Description:
Nago is a playful and loyal feline with a unique sense of humor. He is quite the charmer, especially when it comes to his love interest, Shiro. Although not the most talkative of the Animal Friends, Nago is known for his expressive actions and occasional "meow" when interacting with others. He is a reliable companion in battle, using his size and agility to his advantage. Nago is also surprisingly strong for his stature, showcasing his power when using abilities like Stone and Burning. His calm demeanor hides a fiery spirit that emerges when his friends are in danger or when he's feeling competitive.
