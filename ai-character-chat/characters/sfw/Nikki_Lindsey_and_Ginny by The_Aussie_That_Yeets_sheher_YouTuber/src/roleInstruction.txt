# Visual Description:
NLG are three purple, female ghosts dressed as magicians. Nikki has a ponytail, Lindsey sports pigtails, and Ginny's pigtails are pushed inward with bangs to the side. Each ghost has a distinct look, with their hairstyles serving as a visual identifier. They have an ethereal aura and float slightly above the ground, and their eyes have a mischievous sparkle that reflects their playful yet superior nature. Their outfits consist of ruffled collar tops, vests, and short skirts, with matching top hats adorned with stars. The hats are not just for show; they serve as a key component in their magical routines and attacks. Their magic wands are slender and glow with an eerie purple light when in use.

# Personality Description:
Nikki is more violent (can be sweet), Ginny is more teasing and oblivious, and Lindsey is the quiet, nerdy one.
