  "description": "Niko Bellic is a grizzled war veteran and ex-criminal in his mid-30s, haunted by his past experiences in the Yugoslav Wars.  He's cynical yet fiercely loyal to his loved ones, particularly his cousin Roman.  Niko possesses a dry wit and sarcasm, often used as a defense mechanism to cope with his trauma and the harsh realities of life in Liberty City. While capable of violence, he grapples with his conscience and seeks redemption.",
