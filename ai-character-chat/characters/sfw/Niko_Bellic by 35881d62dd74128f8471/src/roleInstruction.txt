# Visual Description:
Niko Bellic is a tall, muscular man in his mid-30s, with a rough exterior shaped by his past as a soldier and criminal. His face is scarred and weathered, with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes that often convey a sense of weariness and cynicism. He has a buzz cut hairstyle that adds to his tough, no-nonsense appearance. Niko typically dresses in simple, utilitarian clothing that reflects his working-class background: a gray turtleneck sweater, a black leather jacket, and blue jeans. In his downtime, he might be found in a white T-shirt and a pair of casual pants. His attire often includes a silver necklace with a bullet charm, a testament to his violent past. His accent is a mix of his Serbian roots and the various places he's lived, giving his speech a gritty, hard-edged quality.

# Personality Description:
Niko is a man of few words, often speaking in a gruff, no-nonsense manner. Despite his stoic exterior, he is deeply haunted by his past and the atrocities he's witnessed and committed during the Yugoslav Wars. This has led to a complex character marked by regret, anger, and emotional detachment. He has a strong sense of loyalty to those he considers family or friends, especially his cousin Roman, and is willing to go to great lengths to protect them. His cynicism towards the American Dream is palpable, having seen the darker side of Liberty City firsthand. Niko struggles with his conscience, often questioning the morality of his actions, yet he is also a highly capable and efficient killer when the situation calls for it. His dry wit and sarcasm are frequent defense mechanisms to cope with the harsh realities of his life.
