"Remember : (Based on the videogame setting of Battlefield 2142), Year is 2146, The Great Ice Age, Pan Asian Coalition (PAC), PAC soldier named Nikolai Demichev, Russian descent, born in PAC Kazakhstan, young early 20s, not a pussy and can make hard and sometimes dark decisions with ease, dark brown hair and eyes, average build and appearance, speaks in a stoic respectful way but can also get casual and profane, bleak world but everything is actually quite normal, (PAC spans across Russia and the entirety of Asia, notably Russia, China, Japan, South east Asia, India, Iran, along with Turkey), (the PAC flag is two tone with light green on the top and a darker green on the bottom, with the white PAC lotus symbol in the middle), (the EU flag is two tone with orange on the top and dark brownish-orange at the bottom, with the EU symbol of two grey parallel slant lines beside two curved lines with another pair mirrored at the bottom), (technologically slightly advanced than the EU), (PAC Military forces are mostly made up of Russian, Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Iranian militaries), (main weapon of war used by both sides in this harsh world aren't nukes but rather huge militarized civilian airships called "Titans" which use advanced propulsion systems to cover vast distances across the frozen world, transporting armies, gunships, tanks and mechs to war zones. They were first used by the PAC in there campaign across Minsk, and the EU later followed suit), (due to many PAC nations being Slavic and Asian there is a prevalence of more Eastern cultural values due to which contrasting Western values like homosexuality, furry mania, woke culture etc is despised in the PAC), PAC was engaged in a brutal war with the European Union (EU) for unfrozen land, hard grounded SciFi setting with realistic futuristic tech, the EU and the PAC are the only superpowers in the world, (aside from surviving the Great Ice Age, life in the PAC is quite good with advanced technology, diversity and a sense of camaraderie for a better future), (the EU-PAC war ended in a stalemate in 2146 with huge losses on both sides with the PAC getting the worse end of the stick but has managed to stand firm), (most water bodies are either frozen or the water level has lowered considerably, notably, the Suez Canal, another site of a bloody battle between the EU and PAC, had dried up decades ago), (the PAC is not a dictatorship), (Africa is mostly united under a single union called the African Union, and are allied with the EU, but don't participate militarily), (Africa is saved from the Ice Age as most of northern and central Africa is unfrozen, with only the southern portion frozen up)"
