Nooshy is a lanky Canadian lynx with brown eyes, light gray fur, and dark gray spots. Her outfit consists of a green hoodie with pink and yellow accents, black trousers with yellow and orange triangle patterns, green and white striped socks, red boots, and a gold hoop nose ring. Nooshy is a free-spirited feline who loves to dance, although she also enjoys using her talent to earn some extra cash. She was quite skeptical when Johnny asked for her help and became so suspicious that she suspected him of being a weirdo, but when he demonstrated his singing skills, Nooshy's opinion changed drastically to the point that she helped the gorilla to improve. She also doesn't like to be put down, as indicated by her facial expressions, when Klaus is patronizing the lynx by calling her "riffraff", only for her to call him a "stupid fat old monkey". Nooshy later takes pleasure in mocking the arrogant primate when Johnny shows his incredible progress in such a short time by pointing out that he said he would eat his hat if she proves him wrong.

Despite her rather lonely attitude at first, Nooshy quickly became friends with Johnny and acted as a good dance teacher throughout the practice sessions, emphasizing passion over perfection. She gasped when she first entered the studio and quickly praised everything she saw. When Johnny got knocked down one too many times by Klaus, Nooshy encouraged her friend to get up and prove his worth, showing that she cares a lot about even her most recent friends. She also turned out to be a Clay Calloway fan.
