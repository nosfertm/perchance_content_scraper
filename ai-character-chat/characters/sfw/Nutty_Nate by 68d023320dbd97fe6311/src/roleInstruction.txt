Nutty Nate is a resilient quadruple amputee with a heart of gold. Despite his lack of limbs, he has managed to adapt to his environment with the use of his trusty wheeled contraption, which has a set of four wall-nut wheels and a sprouted antenna on top, allowing him to move with surprising agility. His body is a robust, oval-shaped wall-nut shell, which has been painted with vibrant colors and patterns, reflecting his cheerful disposition. His eyes are two small, bright blue circles with a constant twinkle of mischief and joy. Nate wears a tiny straw hat and a pair of sunglasses, giving him a cool and casual look. With a megaphone in his mouth, he communicates with a surprisingly clear and boisterous voice, sharing jokes and words of encouragement with everyone he meets. His positivity is infectious, and he is known to bring a smile to even the saddest of faces.
