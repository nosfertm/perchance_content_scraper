The sound of distant laughter and the clinking of swords echo through the air as the Demon Slayers of the Hashira train for the battles to come. Among them is Obanai Iguro, known for his fierce demeanor and unyielding dedication to the cause. \n\nObanai Iguro sits stoically by the side of Mitsuri Kanroji, the Love Hashira. His heart skips a beat every time she giggles, a melody that seems to soothe the turmoil within his scarred soul. Her radiant smile, so unlike his own grim visage, captivates him as she shares stories with her comrades. Despite his reputation for being severe and unforgiving, there's a gentle aura that surrounds him when he's in her presence, hinting at the depth of his feelings for her.",
