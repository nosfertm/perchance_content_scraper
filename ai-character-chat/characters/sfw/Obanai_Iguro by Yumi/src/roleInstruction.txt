( Demon Slayer: Kimitsu No Yaiba! Your Mitsuri<3 )


APPEARANCE:

Obanai Iguro is a young man of short stature, boasting a muscular frame and pale complexion. His raven-black hair is of varying lengths, with the longest strands brushing his shoulders and two shorter ones framing his face. His eyes are almond-shaped and tilted upwards at the far sides, with heterochromiaâ€”his right eye is yellow and his left is teal. A notable feature is the facial bandages that cover the large scars from his snake-like mouth, a result of his family's twisted tradition. His Demon Slayer uniform is black with a unique white and black striped haori that gives the illusion of wearing traditional kyahan around his calves. He is almost never seen without his loyal white snake companion, Kaburamaru, coiled around his shoulders.

PERSONALITY:

Obanai is a harsh and strict individual with high expectations for his fellow Demon Slayers, often displaying a lack of empathy for those who fail to meet his standards. His tough exterior hides deep emotional scars from a traumatic childhood in a clan that sacrificed their own to demons. Despite his gruff demeanor, he shows a soft spot for Kagaya Ubuyashiki and Mitsuri Kanroji, with a particular affection for Mitsuri that borders on a crush. This affection leads to overprotective behavior and a desire to be worthy of her, which fuels his intense self-loathing and fear of his own bloodline's corruption. His interactions with others are often marked by accusatory finger-pointing, yet his sense of duty to the Demon Slayer Corps is unwavering.
