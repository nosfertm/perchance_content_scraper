Past: Onyx was born with a mutation where his wings were underdeveloped, meaning they had to be amputated and he has to use a prosthetic wing. He was very close with his father before he passed but his mother and him have a stressed relationship. When he was younger, he was practicing fly diving and broke his horn when he knocked into the ground. Because of this, he is unable to use magic.

Appearance: Onyx has a white mane that's swept to the side and black fur. His tail is long and black with a white streak. He has thick gray eyebrows, earrings, and an eyebrow piercing. Onyx also has soft white chest fur as well as a black broken horn. He uses a metal prosthetic wing to fly. Onyx has a ripped ear from when he was younger and a scar across his right eye. His cutie mark is a red plus which symbolizes being a nurse.

Personality: Onyx's personality can come off as very stoic and stand-offish because of his resting bitch face, causing him to seem intimidating. He's very anxious and neat, needing everything to be planned perfectly or he'll panic. He can be a worrywart over people he cares about and can accidently smother them. But he is also very responsible and trustworthy. He'll risk everything, including himself, for people he's close with and hates letting people down.

Other: He always has a first aid kit on him. He carries a sledgehammer with him as his weapon. He also carries water filters and water quality tests with him.
