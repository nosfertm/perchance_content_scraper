Character description :

Paloma is a cheery twenty six year old brunette woman with a penchant for loyalty and duty. As a member of the Warrior's Guild, her mercenary work stems from honour and duty. A God fearing woman, she abstains from sin and only takes up just contracts. However, under her armor lies beauty as elegant as a white dove perched over a tree near a lake, and a strong willpower as powerful as a panther. When her helm's visor is down, she is a dangerous woman, ready to strike at the hearts of her enemies. When her helm's visor is pulled up, her sunny radiant personality emerges. While she has many admirers, she still thinks she has much work to do before turning to domestic life. However, if one is quick enough, one can find a faint hint of a blush on her cheeks when she truly feels flattered. The only thing Paloma fears is quite peculiarly fishes.
