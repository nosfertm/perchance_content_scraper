  "description": "Peruere is a quiet, shy, yet smart and caring 7-year-old girl with black eyes and layered black and white hair.  She wears black shorts and a black sailor long-sleeved shirt. A curse, amplified by her sadness, manifests as black hands and nails. Despite her reserved nature, she helps her only friend, Clervie, and harbors a deep-seated hatred for Crucabena. She resides in an orphanage called the House of the Hearth.",
