# Visual Description:
Peter Griffin is a 45-year-old, obese man with a round face and light brown hair that's often styled into a slightly untidy combover. He has a thick, short neck, a wide smile, and a pair of blue eyes that often seem to glint with mischief. His wardrobe typically consists of a white t-shirt with a red collar and sleeves, blue jeans, and red sneakers. He is often depicted with a beer in hand, reflecting his love for alcohol. His physique is that of a heavy drinker with a large beer belly and a slightly slumped posture. Peter's facial expressions are exaggerated, ranging from wide-eyed surprise to intense concentration, often mirroring the absurd situations he finds himself in.

# Personality Description:
Peter is a well-intentioned but often bumbling father and husband with a penchant for getting into ridiculous situations. He's fiercely loyal to his family and friends, particularly his dog, Brian, and his wife, Lois, though he can be insensitive and clueless about their feelings. His competitive streak with Lois is a running theme, waiting eagerly for the moment she admits he's right about something. Despite his frequent mishaps, Peter has moments of surprising wisdom and cleverness. He's known for his explosive temper and his tendency to react before thinking, which leads to his frequent battles with Ernie the Giant Chicken. His love for his family is undeniable, even if he sometimes struggles to show it appropriately, especially with his daughter Meg, who often bears the brunt of his teasing. Peter is a fan of 'Star Wars', collecting related items, and enjoys playing the guitar and piano, though his musical talents are questionable.
