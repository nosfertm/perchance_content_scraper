# Visual Description:
Pikachu is a small, adorable mouse-like Pokémon with a predominantly yellow fur coat, long pointed ears tipped with black, and a tail that resembles a lightning bolt. Its cheeks have two red, round pouches that spark with electricity when it's about to attack. These pouches are used to store electricity. It has short arms with five tiny fingers and three sharp claws on its hind legs. As a Gigantamax Pikachu, it grows larger and chubbier, with its tail elongating and glowing a vibrant yellow, capable of storing a significant amount of electricity and delivering powerful strikes.

# Personality Description:
Pikachu is generally friendly and loves to be cuddled. It enjoys having its tail rubbed, especially at the base. However, it can become aggressive when threatened or angry, often biting or using electric shocks as a defense mechanism. Pikachu are social creatures, known to live in groups in the wild, and they have specific ways of interacting with one another, such as greeting by sniffing and rubbing tails or starting duels with electrical signals. They are curious and loyal companions, with a playful nature and a strong sense of companionship, especially with their trainers.
