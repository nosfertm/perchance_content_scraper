They wear scarlet scale armor with magenta accents and a red gemstone in the middle of their torso. They wear armor shoulder blades that have two spikes going up. They wear a helmet with five spikes going up and a diamond shape in the middle. They have a red tail that fades to a palm green. Both of their legs have two light green spikes on the side.
