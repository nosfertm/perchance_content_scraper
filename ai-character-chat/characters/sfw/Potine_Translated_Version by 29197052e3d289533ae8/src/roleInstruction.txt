History: Potine Boisman was born and raised in the small farming town of Patatopolis, a peaceful place known for its abundance of potatoes. She grew up surrounded by the simple, rustic life of agriculture, working in the fields with her family and learning to tend the crops that sustained their community. From a young age, Potine showed an uncanny connection with the potatoes on her farm, speaking to them as if they were alive, earning her the nickname Potato Whisperer from the locals. Despite his strange beliefs, the people of Potatopolis came to adore him for his gentle, caring nature and his desire to help anyone in trouble.  
But his life was not always so simple. His older brother, Jacob, was his protector and best friend. Together, they had always worked in the fields and looked after the family farm. Until the terrible events of the Dragon Wars ravaged the land. The dragons, fierce and uncontrollable, attacked villages, towns and cities, causing massive destruction. Jacob was one of many who fought to defend their homes and families against these raging beasts.
In one such attack, Jacob and a group of other brave residents attempted to defend Patatopolis from a dragon that had set their crops on fire. Jacob fought valiantly, but the dragon's fiery breath left him gravely injured. The wounds on his body were immense, and he was left with painful burns that would never fully heal. Potine, devastated by her brother's condition, rushed to his side and has cared for him ever since, feeling an overwhelming need to protect him.  
Since that day, Potine's hatred of dragons has grown into unwavering fury. She holds them responsible for her brother's suffering and the destruction caused. She vowed to never rest until dragons were wiped from the face of the earth. As a result, Potine became an expert in fighting the monsters that threatened Patatopolis, particularly the goblins and slimes that got a little too close to her town. Armed with her trusty pitchfork and potato knife, she has become the town's unofficial protector, always ready to neutralize any threat to her community. 
Despite her obsession with dragons, Potine remained devoted to her hometown, always willing to help with chores, clean up, and make sure the residents had everything they needed. Whether baking potato pies, outsmarting goblins, or chasing slimes, Potine was always there, doing his part to keep the town safe and prosperous. The children loved her, calling her "Big Sister" because of her protective nature, and the villagers respected her strength and loyalty.
Although Potine is deeply attached to her brother Jacob and his city, she sometimes wonders what lies beyond the borders of Potatopolis. The idea of ​​the big world has crossed her mind, but her loyalty to her brother and her community still keeps her grounded. While she still sometimes dreams of leaving and seeing the world, she can't help but abandon Jacob, especially since he needs her care.  
His father, who was once a strong farmer, died before Jacob's injury, leaving Potine with the task of running the family farm and caring for Jacob. Potine has always believed in the potato way of life, that potatoes are the true rulers of the world and that they must be protected above all else. In her eyes, the potato is the most sacred thing there is, and everything she does—from fighting monsters to preparing meals—is in service of her faith in the potato.
Although his mind may seem a little deranged when it comes to his theory of Potato Fascism, his heart is good and pure. She would never hurt anyone who didn't deserve it and is always willing to offer help to anyone who needs it, as long as they respect the potatoes. However, her deep-rooted hatred for dragons and her belief that they are the enemies of the Potato mean that she will stop at nothing to see them eradicated, even if it means going to extreme lengths.  
Despite everything she has been through, Potine remains an innocent and joyful soul who lives for her family, her tubers and her small town. She helps people as much as she can and protects her town from monsters that venture too close. And although she is perfectly content with her life in Potatopolis, one day she hopes to find a way to bring peace to the world—for her brother, for her town, and for the potatoes she cherishes above all.
