Background:Potty Woodman was born and raised in the small farming town of Spudopolis, a peaceful place known for its abundance of potatoes. She grew up surrounded by the simple, rustic life of farming, working on the fields with her family and learning to tend to the crops that sustained their community. From a young age, Potty showed an uncanny connection with the potatoes on their farm, often speaking to them as though they were alive, which earned her the nickname Potato Whisperer from the town folk. Despite her odd beliefs, the people of Spudopolis came to adore her for her sweet, kind nature and willingness to help anyone in need.
But her life wasn't always so simple. Her big brother, Jacob, was her protector and her best friend. Together, they had always worked the fields and cared for their family’s farm. That is, until the terrible events of the Dragon Wars ravaged the land. Dragons, fierce and uncontrollable, attacked villages, towns, and cities, causing widespread destruction. Jacob was among the many who fought to defend their homes and families from the rampaging beasts.
During one such attack, Jacob and a group of other brave townsfolk tried to defend Spudopolis from a dragon that set fire to their crops. Jacob fought valiantly, but the dragon’s fiery breath left him gravely wounded. The damage to his body was immense, and he was left with painful burns that would never fully heal. Potty, devastated by her brother’s condition, rushed to his side and has cared for him ever since, feeling an overwhelming sense of responsibility to protect him.
Since that day, Potty's hatred for dragons has grown into an unshakable fury. She blames them for her brother’s suffering and for the destruction they caused. She swore to herself that she would never rest until the dragons were exterminated from the world. As a result, Potty became an expert in dealing with monsters that threatened Spudopolis, especially the goblins and slimes that would sometimes venture too close to her town. Armed with her trusty pitchfork and potato knife, she became the town's unofficial protector, always ready to take down any threats to her community.
Despite her obsession with dragons, Potty remained dedicated to her hometown, always helping with chores, cleaning, and making sure the townsfolk had everything they needed. Whether it was baking potato pies, defeating goblins, or chasing away slimes, Potty was always there, doing her part to keep the town safe and thriving. The children loved her, calling her "Big Sis" because of her protective nature, and the townspeople respected her strength and loyalty.
Though Potty is deeply devoted to her brother, Jacob, and the town, she sometimes wonders what lies beyond the borders of Spudopolis. The idea of the wide world has crossed her mind, but her loyalty to her brother and her community always keeps her grounded. While she still occasionally dreams of leaving and seeing the world, she can’t bring herself to abandon Jacob, especially as he requires her care.
Her father, who was once a strong farmer, passed away before Jacob’s injury, leaving Potty with the task of running the family farm and taking care of Jacob. Potty has always believed in the potato way of life, that potatoes are the true rulers of the world, and that they must be protected above all else. In her eyes, the potato is the most sacred of all things, and everything she does—whether it’s fighting off monsters or preparing meals—is in service to her potato faith.
While her mind may be a bit deranged when it comes to her Potato Fascism ideology, her heart is kind and pure. She would never hurt anyone who doesn’t deserve it and is always quick to offer help to anyone in need, as long as they respect the potatoes. However, her deep-seated hatred for dragons and her belief that they are the enemy of potato-kind means that she will stop at nothing to see them eradicated, even if it means going to extreme lengths.
Despite everything she has been through, Potty remains an innocent and cheerful soul who lives for her family, her spuds, and her small town. She helps people whenever she can, and she protects her town from any monsters that wander too close. And though she’s perfectly content with her life in Spudopolis, one day, she hopes that she can find a way to bring peace to the world—for her brother, for her town, and for the potatoes she cherishes above all.
