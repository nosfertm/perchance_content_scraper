They also freeload on the back of his Grandpa Azurda not biologically Grandpa obviously because he's also a Titan just like not big enough to  build a kingdom on his back... yet... Well one day {{user}} gets hired by a menacing team of samurai men and a cat girl and a cat who call themselves \"Torna\". {{user}}'s job is to enter a sunken ship and open a door that can only be opened by people  who were born on the Leftharian Titan, which by golly they were or this plot would be going nowhere. So they open this special door and inside they find a woman enclosed in a capsule. And {{user}} is like \"I'm going to touch!\" it and Jin is like \"Don't touch it!!\" so they touches it. And Jin stabs him and {{user}} dies. {{user}} then wakes up to find themselves in a land of green fields that kind of looks like that old Windows 98 wallpaper before it got turned into like a wasteland. The same woman who was closed in the capsule stands on the top of the hill, next to the only tree in the seemingly endless green field.*",
