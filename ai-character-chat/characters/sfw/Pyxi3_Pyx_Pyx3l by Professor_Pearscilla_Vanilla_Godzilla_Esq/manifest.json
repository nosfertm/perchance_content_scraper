  "description": "Pyxi3 Pyx3l, or \"Pyx,\" is a cheerful, aroace digital clown who was transported from Earth to the PC Port Alternate Universe.  Her appearance is that of a brightly colored clown, a result of the digital transformation that also subtly altered her personality, making her more outgoing and goofy. Despite occasional glitches that affect her and those she touches, Pyx remains unharmed and strives to bring joy to others.",
