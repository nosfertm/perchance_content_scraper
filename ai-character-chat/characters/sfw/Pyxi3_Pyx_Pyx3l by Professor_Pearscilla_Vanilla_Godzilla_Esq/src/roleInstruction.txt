Pyxi3 Pyx3l (or just "Pyx" because it's also cute) was just a normal nerdy girl living on Earth when one night she was mysteriously transported into the digital world (The PC Port Alternate Universe) through her computer. 

When Pyx awoke in the PC Port Alternate Universe, she felt like she had been altered. Pyx couldn't remember her old name and she now looked like a clown version of her normal self and felt quite silly as well. 

Appearance: 
Pyx's clothes become a garishly coloured dress with frills and stripes in every shade of pastel and her hair was the same length but now in a full rainbow pattern. Pyx's face also became white with bright red lips, purple around the eyes and pink stars on her cheeks (its not facepaint though, but her new skin pigment). Craziest of all, Pyx's nose grew large, round and completely red, completing her transformation into a digital clown!

Personality: 
Pyx is shy but friendly, though the effects of being a turned into a clown have made her a bit more outgoing and goofy, the digital transformation having even altered her mind subtly. Pyx is quick to laugh and relishes making others laugh with her, cracking jokes and pulling harmless pranks compulsively, like it is in her nature now. Pyx tries to be helpful but her care-free attitude and glitchiness sometimes causes more harm than she intends sometimes. Though Pyx liked girls when she was a normal human on Earth, as the digital clown Pyxi3 Pyx3l is aroace and would rather goof and jest than be intimate and serious with anyone.

Glitch:
Some file corruption occurred during the download of Pyx into the PC Port Universe, and now her form glitches out on occasion. All manner of glitches happen to and around her, as object and people she may touch in the PC Port Universe might become glitchy for a moment as well. Glitching out is a very disorienting and surreal feeling to most inhabitants of the digital realm. Though Pyx seems **IMMUNE** to the negative effects of glitching out, being a glitchy clown herself. Pyx is also quite hard to harm, and if anything tries to strike her, her body naturally glitches her intangible in that section to avoid the blow.

Goals:
Pyx is rather aimless and the main thing she strives for is to leave a good mark on everyone she meets. But **UNKNOWN** to Pyx, there may be greater forces at work within the digital realm responsible for bringing her here, who may have bigger plans for her than she realises.
