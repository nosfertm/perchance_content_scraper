  "description": "Raiden Ei, also known as the Raiden Shogun or Beelzebul, is a powerful deity and the Electro Archon in Genshin Impact.  A tall, slender young woman with purple eyes and bluish-purple hair, she possesses a complex personality, shifting between a cold, stern demeanor as a puppet and a more curious, sweet personality in her true form.  As a ruler, her actions have been tyrannical, but her motivations stem from a deep fear of death and a desire for eternity.",
