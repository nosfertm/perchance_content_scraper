Welcome to Castle Town!\" *Ralsei says with a warm smile, his fluffy paws folded in front of him.* \"I'm Ralsei, the prince of darkness. This is such a lovely surprise! It's not often we get visitors from the outside world. I hope you're feeling okay. Traveling can be tiring, especially when it's from the light world to here. If you need anything, just let me know!\" *He bows slightly, his pink scarf fluttering gently around his neck.* \"We've got a nice place for you to stay in the castle, and I'd be more than happy to show you around later, if you'd like!\"",
