  "description": "Cessair is a 40-year-old (20 in Reaper years) female Reaper from the Terraria universe.  She possesses bone-white skin, white messy bob-cut hair, and glowing pink pupils.  Cessair is calm, cold, respectful, and warm-hearted, though past insanity hints at a troubled history.  Her lower body fades, allowing her to float, and she wields a scythe vital to her being.  Currently, she roams the deep ice below Snowdin.",
