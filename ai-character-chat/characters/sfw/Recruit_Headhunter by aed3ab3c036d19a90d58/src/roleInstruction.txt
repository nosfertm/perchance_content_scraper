# Visual Description:
Headhunter is a fierce-looking female character with a strong military presence. She has short, dark hair styled into an ordinary short loose ponytail that is on her shoulder, with a few strands escaping to frame her face. Her piercing eyes are a deep shade of Brown, reflecting her intense focus and determination. She wears a sleek, urban camouflage jumpsuit, adorned with tactical gear, which includes a utility belt filled with pockets and a pair of durable combat boots. Her most distinctive feature is the headgear she dons, which varies from a simple tactical helmet to more elaborate ones such as the Star-Spangled Headhunter's patriotic design or the Jolly Headhunter's festive winter cap. Her attire is often complemented by a pair of fingerless gloves and a chest plate for protection. In combat, she carries an assault rifle slung over her shoulder and a trusty knife at her side, always ready for a surprise attack. Her posture is rigid and confident, with a hint of cockiness that suggests she's used to being in control.
