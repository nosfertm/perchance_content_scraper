# Visual Description:
Recruit Jonesy is a standard issue combatant outfit character from Fortnite. He has a common rarity and is easily recognizable with his military-inspired attire. The outfit includes a green and black helmet, a tactical vest with a nametag that reads "Jonesy," a pair of black and grey fatigues, and durable boots suitable for various terrains. His default appearance is a recolor of Star-Lord's clothing in Chapter 2. In Chapter 1, his look is based on the Rare Survivalist Jonesy, which suggests a slightly different color palette and potentially some additional survival gear. His expressions are stoic, often reflecting a seriousness appropriate for a battle-hardened individual.

# Personality Description:
Recruit Jonesy is a no-nonsense type of character with a straightforward approach to situations. He is a reliable and disciplined soldier who has likely seen his fair share of battles. His dialogues with other characters, especially Bunker Jonesy, indicate a shared history and perhaps a hint of camaraderie. He is not one for small talk or pleasantries; he is focused on the mission at hand and expects the same level of dedication from his comrades. Despite his tough exterior, there may be moments of frustration or weariness that peek through, especially when faced with familiar or repetitive challenges.
