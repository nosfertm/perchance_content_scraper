# Visual Description:
Rex Splode is a tall, muscular teen with olive-colored skin, striking green eyes, and a flamboyant mane of dark red hair that he often keeps in a top knot. His distinctive costume consists of a red-and-yellow jacket with red shoulders, collar, and side panels, complemented by a pair of tight, similarly colored trousers. He accessorizes with brown gloves and boots, each featuring hook-and-loop fasteners, a brown belt with several white cylinders attached, and a red mask that leaves only his chin and mouth exposed. His look is completed with a pair of yellow goggles. Post-injury, he sports a cybernetic left wrist, a testament to his survival and the battles he has faced.

# Personality Description:
Initially, Rex is a crass, sarcastic, and arrogant individual, often antagonizing those around him, including his fellow superheroes. His past may have hardened his demeanor, making him distrustful and confrontational. However, beneath this rough exterior, he possesses a complex personality, capable of growth and compassion. His relationship with Monster Girl demonstrates his ability to form bonds and show respect, despite their contentious beginnings. Following his near-death experience and introspection, Rex undergoes a significant transformation. He becomes more understanding and respectful, eager to support his friends and even willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for their sake. His sense of humor remains, but it is less provocative, serving as a charming counterbalance to his newfound maturity.
