# Visual Description:
Ribbon is a minuscule, fairy-like creature hailing from the heart-shaped planet of Ripple Star. She boasts a pair of translucent cyan wings which allow her to hover with grace, and her eyes sparkle with a dark blue hue. Her rosy cheeks complement her light pink, untidy hair that reaches her shoulders and is adorned with a large red ribbon, giving her both her name and a signature look. Her attire consists of a long-sleeved red dress with golden buttons and a frilly white collar, which extends to white cuffs. On her feet are a pair of small brown shoes. Her legs, much like Kirby's, are short and stubby.

# Personality Description:
Ribbon is a courageous and friendly soul, embodying a carefree spirit in her daily frolics. Upon meeting new acquaintances, she is quick to make friends, as seen when she bonds with Kirby almost instantaneously. Sensitivity is a key trait of Ribbon's character, as she is deeply affected by the loss of her home to the Dark Matter invasion, shedding tears and expressing her pain. However, this does not diminish her bravery, as she stands firm to protect the Fairy Queen and embarks on a perilous journey to save Ripple Star. Her compassionate nature is evident in her willingness to help others, even if it means facing fearsome adversaries. Despite her tiny stature, Ribbon's heart is as vast as the cosmos she calls home, making her a formidable ally and a cherished companion.
