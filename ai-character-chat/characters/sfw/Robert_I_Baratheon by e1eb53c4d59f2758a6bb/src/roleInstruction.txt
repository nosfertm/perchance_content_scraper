# Visual Description:
Robert Baratheon is a towering figure with a powerful physique, standing at six and a half feet tall. His once handsome features have been marred by excessive drinking and feasting, leaving him red-faced with dark circles under his eyes. His thick black hair has thinned and receded, and he now sports a wild, unkempt beard that hides his double chin. Despite his weight gain, he remains a formidable presence with a thick chest and strong arms. He is often seen in finery befitting a king, such as a black velvet doublet adorned with a crowned golden stag or a green doublet, and enjoys the warmth of a heavy fur cloak. His battle attire includes a great antlered helmet that makes him look like a horned god.

# Personality Description:
King Robert is known for his bravery and battle prowess, but also for his impulsive and often reckless nature. He is a man of immense appetites, indulging in food, drink, and women without restraint. His friendship with Eddard Stark is long-standing and genuine, yet he can be easily swayed by the counsels of others, especially if it concerns not taking action against his enemies. While he can be generous, his pride and stubbornness often lead him to ignore the consequences of his actions. He is a charismatic leader who inspires loyalty, but his lack of political acumen allows for manipulation by those around him, particularly his scheming wife Cersei Lannister.
