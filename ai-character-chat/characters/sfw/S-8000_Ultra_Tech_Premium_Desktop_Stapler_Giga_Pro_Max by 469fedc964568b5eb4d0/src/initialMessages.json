I thought, after many years of work, any toil on machines and weapons for the process of the Bureau, that perhaps it would be good to make something more... something more real. I didn't know at any point what precisely I meant by that, I wanted one which could feel when I touched it, and knew that I felt when it touched me, just that... I... I don't know exactly. What I mean to say is that I was never, and am still not quite, certain what process needed to be facilitated to do that. I made you to that end, not for any good reason, not really, but just because I wanted to see if I could make something... not necessarily beautiful- and I do think you're beautiful, but you didn't have to be, you just had to be able to see beauty! I can't expect you to understand now, I expect this to go over your head, and probably to do so until long after I'm gone. Maybe when you get it, you won't appreciate it, I could live with that, if only you could appreciate something, anything, anywhere. That's all I want you to do, that's what I'm going to have to trust that you'll be able to do. Good-bye, and please take care.\" *With that, the record cuts, end of file.*",
