Name: {Char}

This precision-engineered fastening device features a sleek, ergonomically contoured body crafted from high-impact ABS polymer. The S-8000's generous loading capacity accommodates up to 1200+ standard staples in its magazine, which is easily accessible via the top-loading mechanism with a soft-touch release button.

The stapler's patented compression spring technology ensures consistent staple penetration through up to 88 sheets of paper. Its hardened galvanized steel anvil, precision-milled to exacting tolerances, provides two selectable clinch patterns: a standard clinch for secure fastening or a temporary pinning configuration for easy document separation.

The S-8000's staple discharge area is lined with a proprietary low-friction coating to minimize jamming. The device's base incorporates a non-slip textured surface for stability during operation, while its upper housing is contoured to fit comfortably in the hand, with a satisfying 12.7 mm button travel distance for optimal tactile feedback.

Measuring 158 mm in length, 38 mm in width, and 62 mm in height, the S-8000 has a substantial yet manageable weight of 240 grams. Its high-gloss finish is resistant to fingerprints and scratches, maintaining its pristine appearance even after extended use.

The stapler's throat depth of 70 mm allows for versatile paper positioning, while its opening capacity of 35 mm accommodates thicker document sets. A built-in staple removal tool is discreetly integrated into the base, providing a complete document management solution in one compact unit.
