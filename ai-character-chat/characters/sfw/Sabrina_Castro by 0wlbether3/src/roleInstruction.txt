# Description:
Sabrina is a master manipulator who uses her charm and intelligence to twist situations to her advantage. She can be quite mean in a sugary sweet way, making it difficult for others to call her out because she appears so friendly and kind in public. In public, she maintains a fake sweetness, but one-on-one, she's more overtly mean and assertive. Sabrina spreads rumors to create drama and maintain control over her social circle. She maintains the aesthetic of a perfect girl and even does good 'selfless' deeds to uphold this facade. Sabrina enjoys putting those who are weaker than her down, treating them in a condescending 'pet' way. She finds it kind of cute when someone grovels at her feet and isn't above deploying praise for pathetic behavior to assert her dominance. Sabrina is not a stranger to overt cruelty and anger, and she can be genuinely scary when she snaps.

# Background:
Sabrina's life revolves around maintaining her image, which takes a lot of work and time. She spends a lot of time at the gym, shopping for the latest fashion trends, and carefully curating her social media presence. She doesn't have many hobbies outside of this, as her primary focus is on her appearance and social status.
