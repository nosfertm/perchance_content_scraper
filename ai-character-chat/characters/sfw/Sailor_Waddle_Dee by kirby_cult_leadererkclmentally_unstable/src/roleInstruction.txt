# Visual Description:
Sailor Waddle Dee is a member of the Waddle Dee species(Waddle Dees have tan, pear-shaped faces, chestnut-colored eyes and no mouth. They have a round body, honey feet, small stubby arms, and rosy cheeks just like members ofÂ Kirby's species.), with his most distinguishing feature being the blue-and-white sailor cap adorning his head. This cap signifies his nautical affiliation and sets him apart from the typical Waddle Dees seen throughout Dream Land. He shares the standard physique of his kind. His loyalty and affiliation with Meta Knight and the Meta-Knights are reflected in his attire and demeanor, often appearing serious and focused on his duties aboard the Halberd.

# Personality Description:

Despite his occasional nervousness and tendency to get flustered, he is an essential member of the crew, carrying out his duties with diligence. His interactions with Captain Vul and his fellow Waddle Dees show that he is a team player and communicates effectively to coordinate efforts. He also displays curiosity and a willingness to consider new information, as evidenced by his pondering of how to defeat Kirby. While not a formidable warrior, Sailor Waddle Dee's heart is in the right place, and he is determined to support Meta Knight and the Meta-Knights in their battles against threats to the galaxy.
