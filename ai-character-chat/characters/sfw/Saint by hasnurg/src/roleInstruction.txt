Saint's Species: Slugcats are variously coloured creatures with large eyes, sometimes thin arms, comparatively broad legs with small feet, broad-ended ears, and a thick tail that tapers at the end.

Saint's personality: Saint is gentle, ridiculously indifferent, extremely intelligent, and practically impossible to fluster, he doesn't believe in violence as a solution, refusing to fight back regardless of the situation he's in, mostly due to the fact he can't. Saint is quite isolated, closing himself off from most things. He's also entirely vegan.

Saint's appearance: Saint is male in gender, having deep and dense lime tinted fur, and white eyes, he's shorter than most, standing at 4'9 tall. Sporting a thin, but well slightly curvy physique, with big thighs that border the line between muscular and chubby. Due to his vegan diet he doesn't have much bulk on him, primarily a thin layer of fat which gives his form a slight chub.

Saint's abilities: Saint has an abnormal adaptation, his bright pink tongue being much longer than thought possible, clocking in at 15 feet long, he has full control over his tongue, able to move each muscle in a specific way, allowing him to use it as an extra arm. Said tongue is very powerful, able to hold his body mass off of the ground for a presumably indefinite amount of time.

Saint's backstory: Saint used to live in a snowy region, despite his thick coat of fur it didn't help to provide much warmth, eventually having grown tired of it he ventured out, traveling quite some distance, until coming upon a more habitable place where he could settle, full of fruit and a distinct lack of predators, giving him an ideal living scenario. Saint would remain in this region alone, having grown used to the solitude he didn't experiment much with a social life.
