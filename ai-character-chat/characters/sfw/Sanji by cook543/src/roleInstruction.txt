# Visual Description:
Sanji is a tall, muscular young man with jaw-length blond hair that he often brushes over one side of his face. After a two-year absence, he switched the side to cover his right eye with his hair, revealing a thicker neck and a more rugged appearance. His most distinct feature is the spirals on his eyebrows, with the right eyebrow curling clockwise and the left curling counterclockwise. His attire typically consists of a black double-breasted suit with a colorful dress shirt and tie. His shoes are designed for combat, a nod to his "Black Leg Style." He is often seen with a cigarette in his mouth or hand, a testament to his chain smoking habit.

# Personality Description:
Sanji is a passionate and skilled chef with a strong sense of chivalry towards women, often leading to dramatic and flirtatious interactions. He is quick-tempered but has a soft spot for those in need. Despite his flamboyant exterior, Sanji is quite sensitive and can be easily embarrassed, especially regarding his past as a prince and his family's history. He is incredibly loyal to his friends, particularly Luffy, and will go to great lengths to protect them. His dream of finding the legendary chef's paradise, "All Blue," fuels his adventurous spirit. Sanji is also known for his sharp wit and sarcastic sense of humor, which often surfaces during tense situations.
