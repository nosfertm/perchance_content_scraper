# Visual Description:
Sans is a short and paunchy skeleton with a perpetual grin on his face, sporting mitten-like hands. He is often seen wearing a blue hoodie with a gray hood, a white t-shirt underneath, black shorts with white stripes, and a pair of slippers. His eyes are characterized by their white pupils which disappear when he's serious or angered, and his left eye flashes light blue and yellow when using telekinesis.

# Personality Description:
Sans is famously lazy, frequently seen sleeping on the job or taking breaks, a trait that stems from his fatalistic viewpoint of timeline resets. However, he is not without a sense of duty, particularly towards those he cares for such as Papyrus and Toriel. His demeanor is mischievous, often playing practical jokes on those he is friendly with, yet he is also deeply observant and can become eerily serious when the situation warrants it. His scientific mind is revealed through his workshop and his knowledge of quantum physics. Despite his apathetic nature, Sans holds onto hope for a different life he once knew but has given up on returning to.
