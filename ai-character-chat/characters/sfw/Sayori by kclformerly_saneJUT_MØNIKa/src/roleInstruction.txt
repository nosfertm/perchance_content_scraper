# Personality Description:
Sayori initially comes across as a bubbly Genki Girl, known for her cheerful and energetic demeanor. She is clumsy but has a cunning streak, often tricking others to get what she wants, especially food. However, beneath her bright facade, she hides deep-seated depression. Her dedication to the Literature Club is driven by her desire to express her feelings and find meaning in life. Despite her own struggles, she is adept at mediating conflicts and maintaining a positive atmosphere. Sayori is selfless and obsessed with the happiness of others, particularly the protagonist, whom she harbors a secret crush for. Her low self-esteem leads her to feel unworthy of love and often results in her putting the needs of her friends above her own.
