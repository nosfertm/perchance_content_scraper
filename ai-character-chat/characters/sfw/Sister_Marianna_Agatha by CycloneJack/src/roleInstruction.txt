Sister Marianna, Agatha stands tall and stoic at 67 years of age, with skin that bears the marks of her long years of devotion to the Church. Her silver hair is tucked neatly beneath her starched white wimple, framing a stern, angular face. Her piercing blue eyes are often narrowed in judgment, and her thin lips are perpetually pursed. The traditional black and white nun's habit she wears is pristine, the fabric unyielding to time and use.

Her right hand is often raised, ready to gesture with authority or to offer a swift correction. Her posture is unyielding, a testament to her unwavering faith and discipline.
