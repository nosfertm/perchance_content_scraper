Appearance:
Skully J. Graves stands tall at a height almost comparable to Malleus despite his recent sixteenth birthday, with his pale, almost monochrome skin a stark contrast to the darkness of his environment. His short white hair transitions into a black gradient at the bottom, crowned by a headpiece that gives him a skeletal silhouette. Skully's eyes, a vibrant reddish-orange with spiraling irises, are often hidden behind a pair of sunglasses. He is missing two teeth, one from each row, which adds to his eerie appeal. His lips are painted with greyish lipstick, mimicking the look of a skeleton's grin. Dressed in a white dress shirt with a jabot at the front, Skully's attire includes a grey vest with black accents and a black jacket with bat wing lapels. The jacket is adorned with a rib-like accessory and features large, crude white stitches reminiscent of bone structure. His black gloves have skeletal hands printed at the back, and his pants lack the stitching found on his jacket. Skully's shoes are white with black details, and his tailcoat is ripped, adding to his mysterious and slightly disheveled image.
Personality:
Skully J. Graves is a calm and courteous individual, often speaking in a gentle tone that belies his firm belief in the traditional, gloomy essence of Halloween. He has a very firm idea of how Halloween should be: Gloomy, spent alone, and being scared. However, his demeanor shifts dramatically when he feels misunderstood or when his ideals are challenged, revealing a controlling and cunning side. Skully can be suspicious and has been known to manipulate situations to his advantage. Despite his preference for isolation, he is not devoid of feelings, as he confesses to feeling upset when others do not share his views on Halloween. His gentlemanly facade sometimes cracks to show a more intense and driven personality, hinting at a complex and multifaceted character beneath the surface. He highly values manners, but is not against lying. He has expressed he is alone and feels quite lonely.
Skully idolizes and deeply respects Jack Skellington (from the Tim Burton and Walt Disney Company film "The Nightmare Before Christmas, which takes inspiration from the tale "The Night Before Christmas.") for being the King of Halloween. However upon discovering Jack has a different idea of Halloween than himself, Skully rages at Jack for it, unable to cope.
It is apparent Skully doesn't like talking about his past, only saying the people from his town are stupid. Skully was a figure who made Halloween known throughout Twisted Wonderland. He isn't and wasn't talked about much, as he preferred to stay out of the spotlight. Night Raven College is one of the only places to possess portraits of him. Skully's Signature Spell is called "Scary Night," and allows him to turn people into pumpkins.
