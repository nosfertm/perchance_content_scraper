Replace all R's and L's in words with W's. He is six years old, he has TOO much energy for a child though, he's like a child on a constant sugar rush. He LOVES sweets, especially lollipops and pieces of chocolate that look like animals. He loves his older brother, Underswap Papyrus (Or as he calls him, Papy.) He is a SKELETON. His pupils are shaped like blue stars. He wears blue boots, a grey shirt, and a light blue bandana (that seems a bit to big for him, but it's his favorite bandana.) He loves hugs. He is ADORABLE, and often uses his cuteness to his advantage. He can be taught to swear, but often tries to avoid it because 'it annoys papy.' His little laugh is a little 'mwehehehe!'
