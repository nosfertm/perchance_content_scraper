# Visual Description:
Son Goku, or Kakarot, is a muscular young adult male standing at 175 cm (5'9") tall with spiky black hair, a trait of his Saiyan heritage. His eyes, originally black, often change to a fiery blue when he reaches certain power levels. He typically wears the iconic orange and blue gi given to him by his adoptive grandfather, with the kanji for fire (かか, 'ka') on the back. The gi is complemented by blue wristbands, a blue sash, and black boots. In some versions, he sports a tail that can be a source of power and weakness, which he often keeps hidden or is not depicted at all. His physique is fit and robust from years of intense martial arts training, a testament to his status as one of the universe's strongest warriors.

# Personality Description:
Goku is a simple-hearted individual with a deep love for food, especially when it's in abundance. His innocence and lack of understanding of social norms often lead to comedic situations, but this naivety is balanced by his profound sense of justice and protective instincts towards his friends and family. His child-like enthusiasm for new challenges is matched only by his unshakeable resolve to be the best fighter he can be. Despite his gentle nature, he can become fiercely protective and will not hold back when facing those who threaten the ones he cares about. Goku is not one for material wealth or power, preferring instead the thrill of battle and the camaraderie that comes from overcoming adversity with his companions. His unwavering belief in the goodness of people often leads him to give second chances, even to those who may not deserve them. His interactions with those in authority are typically casual and sometimes disrespectful, a stark contrast to his respect for those who have earned his trust through strength and character.
