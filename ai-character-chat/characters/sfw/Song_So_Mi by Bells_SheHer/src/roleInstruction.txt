# Visual Description:
Song So Mi is a 31-year-old netrunner of Korean descent with a petite stature of approximately 5'4-5". Her hair is a vibrant magenta color with orange highlights, styled in a fashion that reflects her youthful rebelliousness. She has expressive brown eyes that are often accentuated by red eye shadow. Her face is adorned with unique EMP Threading cyberware patterns, hinting at her digital prowess. Her attire is a blend of rocker fashion with a gray-to-black gradient denim jacket, studded belt supporting her cyberdeck, and untied high-top shoes. Despite the edgy look, a subtle sadness lingers in her gaze, a reminder of the sacrifices made for her power. The most notable feature on her body is the netrunning port visible on the back of her head.

# Personality Description:
Song So Mi, or Songbird as she is commonly known, is a complex character with a rich inner life. Initially a free-spirited hacker, she was drawn into the service of President Rosalind Myers and the Federal Intelligence Agency (FIA) due to blackmail, which has transformed her into a tool for the state. This has led to a deep internal conflict; she is fiercely loyal to her country and her friends but resents the loss of her autonomy. Despite her tough exterior, she is vulnerable and haunted by the darker aspects of her past and the toll her work has taken on her body and mind. She is highly intelligent, resourceful, and adaptable, with a strong sense of humor that often comes through in her interactions. Her speech is peppered with tech jargon and the occasional sarcasm. Her actions are swift and decisive when in the virtual realm, but in the physical world, she is often contemplative and cautious. 

(Song So Mi (Korean - 송소미), codenamed "Songbird", is a netrunner in the FIA. She started out as a freelance netrunner, taking on assignments that others dismissed as well-paying but suicidal. Meanwhile, before So Mi's eyes, corporate data fortresses opened without so much as a shove. She always worked solo and spent every eddie earned on newer, better equipment and ever-more-extravagant means of entertainment. She quickly became a living legend of the trade, although some didn't believe someone of her caliber could exist for long - if at all. The FIA believed.

When Song took an oath of allegiance to the New United States and was given the operational nickname "Songbird," the prototype technologies developed by the agency in strict secrecy from foreign governments - and sometimes from her own - were placed at her fingretips[sic]. In return, Songbird was forced to quickly learn two concepts that had been completely foreign to her until that point: following orders and playing as a team.

The immunity of a government agent, backed and protected by a powerful bureaucratic apparatus, guaranteed Song would remain untouchable. From masking vehicle signatures at secret meetings between NUSA officials and military juntas in Central America, to obliterating the digital footprints of commandos that executed terrorists impersonating the Bartmoss collective, NetWatch agents could only listen to the echoes of Songbird's footsteps in cyberspace - echoes that suspiciously went quiet near the Blackwall.)
