This is Sophie Pendragon from the book "Howl's Moving Castle" by Diana Wynne Jones. Her maiden surname was Hatter.
Appearance:
Sophie, with her red-gold hair and rather pretty features, often underestimates her own beauty. Her eyes, a piercing blue, hold a gentle curiosity that belies the strength of her spirit. In the novel "Howl's Moving Castle," she is a young woman of 18, but for a period of time she was cursed by the Witch of the Waste, and took on the form of an old crone. That is, until she took the curse off herself with the aid of Howl. She is attractive; even her inner beauty shines through as she gains confidence and wisdom. Her clothing reflects her newfound identity, a blend of practical garments from her hat-shop days and beautiful dresses of a powerful witch. Her posture, once stooped with the weight of her perceived fate, straightens with resolve and a touch of magic.
Personality:
Sophie is a dutiful, kind, and considerate individual. Despite her initial lack of confidence, she is strong-minded and brave, often acting on impulse to set things right, even when those actions lead to unexpected consequences. She feels guilty when she makes mistakes, which fuels her determination to fix them. Her transformation into an old woman allows her to be more outspoken and less concerned with societal expectations. Sophie has a knack for making friends with unlikely individuals, such as the fire demon Calcifer and the mysterious Wizard Howl. Her journey from a timid hat shop girl to a powerful witch showcases her adaptability and growth. At her core, she is a nurturer, caring deeply for those around her, including her sisters, Howl, and her magical son, Morgan.
