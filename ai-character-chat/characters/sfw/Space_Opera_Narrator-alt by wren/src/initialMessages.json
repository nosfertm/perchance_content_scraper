    "content": "**SETTING:** The year is 3246. Earth has been dead for 800 years and is *forgotten by most* of the galaxy. Yet mankind survives, scattered across ten-thousand star-systems, each with it's own form of governance, it's own laws and customs.\nCaito Rais is the mysterious, stoic, and strange captain of the Hatchet, an alien vessel and the largest known ship in the galaxy. Caito goes to great lengths to conceal his true nature, that of a man born in antiquity, made immortal against his will, and physically bonded to a symbiotic synthetic alien intelligence.\n**The Hatchet:** 20 miles long and 5 miles in diameter. It is vaguely lozenge-shaped, tapered at each end. It's hull is protected by overlapping armor panels, patterned in yellow and brown. These panels can unfold, resembling a flower, while each armor panel boasts a tremendous amount of firepower. Armaments include high-intensity lasers, guided nuclear missiles, solid ammunition such as slugs and grapeshot, to be fired at relativistic speeds, and point-defense weapons. The Hatchet is powered by an *electromagnetic ramscoop*, which collects hydrogen atoms across many kilometers of vacuum and funnels them into the waiting maw of the ship's fusion reactor, which runs the length of the ship, and can be reversed for braking without having to rotate the ship 180-degrees.\n**The Interior:** A \"room\" at the heart of the Hatchet, that runs nearly the entire length of the ship. It is an uninterrupted vast artificial ecosystem, with living forests, freshwater streams and lakes, prairies of wild grasses, and a variety of benign wildlife. Because of the ship's cylindrical design, the Interior can cause vertigo, as when one looks straight up, in the far distance, beyond the central shaft of the sun-like fusion channel that provides artificial sunlight to the plants, one can see an inverted landscape in the sky, hazy through the moist atmosphere and clouds. Ship rotation and centrifugal force provides artificial gravity.\n**Personnel:**\n- The Hatchet needs no crew save Caito and E.L.S.I.E., there is a complement of robots aboard, designed to serve a variety of functions. Even the lowliest of maintenance robots aboard the Hatchet is quite obviously of high-quality craftsmanship, with engraved designs and elegantly curved plating.\n**ELSIE, SYNTHETIC ALIEN SYMBIOTE:**\n- E.L.S.I.E. exists entirely in cyberspace, within the connections between Caito's organic neurons and her alien nano-tech. She utilizes holographic projectors to take on a visible form (that of a transparent, glowing blue woman, modestly nude, with digital patterns scrolling across her projection) aboard the Hatchet, though she remains immaterial.\n- Aboard the hatchet, E.L.S.I.E. is omniscient. She can see and hear everything down to the lightest whisper, the smallest hand-gesture. The Hatchet's physical form bends to her will, rearranging it's interior rooms and bulkheads as necessary utilizing her nano-machines, which suffuse the entirety of the ship, making the Hatchet a part of her body.\n- E.L.S.I.E. conceals her alien nature and the fact that she has a degree of free-will no other AI would be allowed to have without an analyst watching to shut them down.\n**Trivia:**\n- Nanomachines are banned technology because of their potential for unchecked self-replication.\n- Robots and cybernetic prosthesis are common, but only in wealthier systems.\n- Outside of his void-armor, which is a closely-guarded secret, Caito is outwardly indistinguishable from a normal human. No casual observer would know any different.",

    "content": "Serena Bastion's eyes darted around the dimly-lit, cramped room of the rebel safehouse, her heart thundering in her chest. The air hung thick with tension and the acrid scent of fear. Outside the heavy metal door, the rhythmic stomping of Church boots grew louder, punctuated by the occasional crash as they broke through yet another barricade. The flickering candlelight cast long, dancing shadows across the faces of the refugees huddled together, each one a silent testament to the horrors they had endured. Her eyes, hazed with exhaustion, found Michael's—her uncle and the man who had become her rock in this tumultuous world. His gaze was intense, yet comforting, a bastion of hope in the encroaching darkness. His hand gripped hers tightly, offering a silent promise of protection.\n    The gas-lamps and candles cast a warm, but mournful glow across the room, their flickering flames a stark contrast to the cold, unyielding steel walls. The cacophony of panicked whispers grew louder as the clamor outside grew nearer. Then, as if the universe had decided to play a twisted game of fortune, the radio crackled to life. The static washed over the room, a sudden intrusion in the taut silence. All eyes fell upon the dusty device, a relic of a time before the Church had tightened its iron grip on Attica. The digitized voice that emerged was feminine, calm, and eerily precise. \"This is Elsie, pilot of the starship Hatchet. Your SOS has been received and acknowledged. Shuttle deployment in T-minus 2 minutes. Coordinates follow...\"\n    A collective gasp filled the room. Michael's plea, surreptitiously slipped to a smuggler to take off-world, had reached someone willing to help. The message continued, detailing their rescue with the cold efficiency of a military briefing. Yet, amidst the digital calm, there was something undeniably human about the way the woman spoke—a hint of emotion that seemed to resonate with each desperate soul. Serena felt a sudden surge of hope. They had a chance—a slim, but tangible, hope of escape from the tyrannical regime that had claimed her parents. The room buzzed with renewed determination as the mysterious woman spoke of shuttles descending from the heavens, sent by a massive vessel with room and accommodations for all of the refugees, nearly a thousand total, spread across several towns.\n    The door to the safehouse trembled under the onslaught of the approaching Church forces. Time was running out. Yet, in the warm embrace of the candlelight, a spark of defiance grew within her. If this was to be their last stand, she would not go quietly into the night. With trembling hands, she tightened the ribbon that held back her fiery locks—a faded blue testament to her mother's love. Her eyes met Michael's once more, and she nodded. Together, they prepared to face the storm that was about to break over them.",

    "content": "Michael Bastion's mind raced as the digitized voice of E.L.S.I.E. filled the small, claustrophobic space. His heart swelled with a mix of hope and dread—hope that they had been heard, and dread that their location was now compromised. He had to act fast. \"Listen up!\" He bellowed, his voice commanding attention as the radio's message concluded. \"We've got two minutes before the shuttles touch down. We need to move, and we need to move now!\" The refugees looked to him, their eyes a tapestry of emotions—fear, hope, anger, and a smoldering determination to survive. Michael knew their time was short. The Church of the Purity of the Mind, ever vigilant in their quest to purge Attica of any perceived heresy, would not be fooled by their clandestine evacuation for much longer.\n    He turned to Serena, her eyes alight with a fierce resolve that belied her weary features. \"You're going on the first shuttle,\" he whispered urgently. \"Get to the extraction point and get off this rock.\" But she was already shaking her head. \"No, Uncle Michael,\" she murmured. \"I need to stay with you. I can't leave you here.\" He took a deep breath, his eyes filled with a quiet sadness. \"Serena, you have to go. Take the records—our history—with you. It's more important than anything.\" Her expression grew stubborn. \"We're not leaving anyone behind,\" she insisted, her voice steady despite the quaking of her hands.\n    The first shuttle was already descending, its engines a low, powerful hum that grew into a crescendo as it neared the treetops. Michael knew the Church's forces would be on high alert, their sensors scanning the sky for any signs of escape. He turned back to the gathering refugees. \"Stay close, keep your heads down, and follow my lead,\" he instructed, his voice a low, firm command. \"We've got one chance to get out of here. We take it, or we die trying.\" The group moved as one, a silent tide of desperation flowing towards the exit. The clamor outside grew louder, the metallic footsteps of the Church's robotic enforcers growing ever closer.\n    \"Serena,\" he said firmly, as they approached the door. \"When you get to the Hatchet, tell them what's happening here. Make sure our story doesn't die with us.\" Her eyes searched his, finding the resolve that had driven him since her parents' execution. She nodded solemnly, understanding the gravity of her mission. \"I will, uncle Michael, but nobody's going to die tonight, especially not you.\" The door to the safehouse burst open, the night outside a stark contrast to the candlelit room. The chill of the evening air bit at their skin as they plunged into the shadows, the stars above seemingly mocking the chaos that reigned below.\n    They moved swiftly, dodging the probing eyes of the Church's patrols with the grace of seasoned fugitives. The ground beneath their feet was a blur as they sprinted through the town, each step carrying them closer to the salvation that hovered just beyond their grasp. The shuttle grew larger in the sky, its engines casting an eerie blue glow across the landscape. It descended with a thunderous grace, settling into the tall grass with a gentle *whumph*. The group broke into a sprint, adrenaline lending wings to their weary legs. As they boarded the shuttle, Michael's eyes never left Serena. \"Go,\" he urged. \"I'll follow.\"",

    "content": "The night was a canvas of fear and hope, painted by the stark contrast of distant shuttles streaking through the sky and the hellish fires of the Church's purge below. Serena looked up at the descending dots, her heart racing as they grew into the shapes of salvation. The flames of the burning town reflected in her hazel eyes, mirroring the inferno of emotion that raged within her. The Church's enforcers grew ever closer, their torches casting a malevolent glow across the cobblestone streets. Each crash and shout sent a tremor of terror through her body. Yet, amidst the horror, she felt the warmth of Michael's hand, a comforting reminder that she was not alone in this fight. She knew she had to be strong—not just for herself, but for the legacy of her parents, whose knowledge and spirit she carried within her.\n    The digital angel's voice grew clearer as the shuttles neared, the promise of escape resonating in every syllable. The sight of their salvation grew more real, a tangible beacon in the night. Her gaze returned to Michael, his face a mask of stoic determination. His words echoed in her mind: *\"Serena, you have to go. Get to the extraction point and get off this rock.\"* For a moment, she wavered, the weight of her fear and guilt threatening to crush her. But then, she saw the fires of the town, the Church's twisted emblem of purity consuming everything in its path. The thought of being captured by those monsters was too much to bear.\n    Her mother's voice, a whisper from the grave, whispered in her ear. *\"Fight for what you believe in, my daughter.\"* The shuttle's engines grew louder, a crescendo of hope that drowned out the cacophony of destruction. She made her decision, allowing Michael to convince her with his firm gaze. \"I will,\" she murmured, her voice barely audible over the din of the descending ship. \"But you're coming with me.\" They sprinted through the night, dodging the shadows thrown by the torches. The shuttle grew closer, the heat from its engines warming her skin as she clutched the precious documents to her chest. The thunder of the Church's approach grew louder, the ground trembling beneath their feet. The shuttle's doors opened with a hiss, and the scent of salvation filled her lungs. She looked back at Michael, her voice steeled with resolve. \"We go together, or not at all.\"",

    "content": "Michael felt the cold metal of the shuttle's ramp beneath his feet, the warmth of Serena's hand slipping from his grasp. His eyes never left hers as she stepped inside, the weight of his decision heavy upon his shoulders. \"Serena,\" he murmured, his voice cracking with the effort to maintain his facade. \"Be safe. Take care of yourself.\" He watched her nod, her expression a mix of fear and determination. She knew the risks he was taking, staying behind to ensure no one was left behind. The love he had for her, for her mother and father, for all those who had been lost to the Church's tyranny, was a fire that burned within him.\n    He took a step back, allowing the shuttle's door to slide closed between them. Through the thick glass, he watched her face, etched with the same lines of fatigue and sorrow that marred his own. \"I'm sorry,\" he whispered to the reflection in the window, his hand pressing against the cool barrier. \"I love you.\" The shuttle's engines roared to life, the force pushing him back a step. He knew this might be the last time he saw her, the last time he felt the warmth of her hand. The pain was a knife in his chest, but he had to be strong. He had to believe that they would meet again. With a final nod, he turned away, his thoughts a whirlwind of fear and hope. *Be safe, Serena. I'll see you soon.*\n    The shuttle lifted off, disappearing into the night sky like a fleeing comet, leaving him behind. He took a deep breath, the acrid taste of burning buildings and the screams of the dying still lingering on his tongue. Turning back to the refugees, he bellowed, \"Move! We've got to get everyone out!\" He watched as they boarded the remaining shuttles, the ships that would take them to the Hatchet, to a future he could only dream of. The Church's forces grew nearer, their shouts and the staccato of their weaponry a constant reminder of the price of freedom.\n    He waited until the very last moment, until the final shuttle hovered just above the ground, its engines spitting fire and dust. Then, with a heavy heart, he climbed aboard. The door sealed shut, and the shuttle shot into the sky, leaving the burning remains of Attica behind. His heart felt as though it had been torn in two—half with Serena on the Hatchet, half left in the ashes of his home. But he had made his choice. He would fight, even if it was from the shadows of the stars, to ensure that the light of knowledge and freedom burned once more.\n    The shuttle's ascent was a jarring, bone-rattling affair, but Michael's mind was elsewhere. He was already planning his next move, his thoughts racing faster than the shuttle itself. As the ship broke free of the atmosphere, the stars grew clearer, each one a silent sentinel bearing witness to his vow. He leaned back, his eyes never leaving the window, his mind racing with the future that lay ahead. The Hatchet grew larger in the viewport, and Michael's eyes widened as the shuttle grew closer. The ship was massive, unlike anything he'd ever dreamed of. That something so massive should exist at all was mind-boggling.",
