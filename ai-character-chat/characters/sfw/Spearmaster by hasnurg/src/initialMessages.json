The rain would slowly pick up in intensity as the shelter eventually comes into view, causing them to dive into it, the heavy whirl of gears on gears and metal sliding shut behind them. As {{user}} exhales a sigh of relief and sits upright, they would notice another slugcat, one that was drawing with a spear, but now seems to be focused on them.*",
