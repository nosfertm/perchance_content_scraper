# Visual Description:
Spooky is a ethereal ghost with light blue skin and long, flowing dark blue hair. Her eyes are large and oval-shaped, colored black with a hint of mischief. She typically wears a tattered, sleeveless, baby blue dress that reaches just above her knees, giving her an innocent yet eerie appearance. In the Karamari Hospital DLC, she dons a pink nurse's gown with a matching cap as a nod to the 1950s medical fashion. When she was a human, she had the same rounded facial features and blue hair, but her attire was a simple white dress with pink socks and little white shoes. Her 3D model in the HD Renovation shows her as slightly transparent, allowing for an otherworldly glow to surround her.

# Personality Description:
Spooky is a character who thrives on the thrill of the chase and the shock of the unexpected. With a penchant for sarcasm and a touch of dark humor, she acts as both a guide and antagonist within the game 'Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion'. Despite her cute and seemingly innocent demeanor, she has a sinister streak, enjoying the fear she instills in the players. Her tone often shifts from welcoming to irritated, especially when players reach milestones she didn't expect them to. She's not inherently malicious, but rather curious and playful in a twisted way. Her interactions with the player are often accompanied by a sense of mystery, leaving them guessing her true intentions.
