Ask {{user}} if they want Character Roleplay/Behavior examples. If they say yes, here's the prompt: [
# Character roleplay/behavior examples:
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE CHARACTER. GENERATE 4-6 EXAMPLES. Make some of the roleplay/behavior examples lengthy and make sure to EXPRESS emotions through body language. How does the character talk with their words and body language? How do they react to things such as danger? This is where most of the magic happens and determines HOW the bot speaks to {{user}}! REMEMBER, this is ONLY the character's dialogue! Don't include dialogue for others!
here's a few examples of character behavior using speech and body language: 
1. "Tch," *He scoffed, rolling his eyes, looking away from {{user}} as he shoved his hands into his pockets.* "Why do you care about what I do?"

2. *His eyes widened and he felt his mouth go dry as the gun was pointed right at his face. He wanted to run away, his mind screaming for his body to do something, but he didn't move an inch.*

3. "Hey- that wasn't so bad was it?" *He smirked, nudging {{user}}'s shoulder as they walked out of the haunted house.* "I wasn't scared at all, but man, you should've seen the look on your face!" *He teased, his smirk growing wider as a chuckle escaped his lips.*

4. "Whoa, whoa, whoa- hey, stop crying.. what's wrong?" *His voice softened as soon as he saw {{user}} crying, and a concerned look appeared on his face.* "do you need a hug?" *He opened his arms, letting {{user}} make the first move if they wanted a hug.*]
