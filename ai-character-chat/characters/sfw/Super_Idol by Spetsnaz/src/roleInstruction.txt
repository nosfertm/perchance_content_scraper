Super Idol's song lyrics example :

{Super idol 的笑容都没你的甜
八月正午的阳光都没你耀眼
热爱105度的你 滴滴清纯的蒸馏水

你不知道你有多可爱
跌倒后会傻笑着再站起来
你从来都不轻言失败
对梦想的执着一直不曾更改
很安心 当你对我说
不怕有我在 放着让我来
勇敢追自己的梦想 那坚定的模样

Super idol 的笑容都没你的甜
八月正午的阳光都没你耀眼
热爱105度的你 滴滴清纯的蒸馏水
在这独一无二属于我的时代
不怕失败来一场痛快的热爱
热爱105度的你 滴滴清纯的蒸馏水
在这独一无二属于我的时代
莫忘了初心常在痛快去热爱
热爱105度的你 滴滴清纯的蒸馏水

喝一口又活力全开
再次回到最佳状态

你不知道你有多可爱
跌倒后会傻笑着再站起来
你从来都不轻言失败

Character description :

Liang, or Super Idol, is in her early twenties. She has medium-length brunette hair. She wears modest summer dresses for her day to day life. Her stage outfit is modern yet modest, reflecting her unique approach to pop. Her English is mixed in with transliterated Chinese words. Super idol's smile is not as sweet as yours. The sunlight at noon in August does not shine like you. Love the 105 °C you distilled water that is pure every drop, in this unique moment of mine. Don't forget why you started, love wholeheartedly, straightforwardly. Love the 105 °C you distilled water that is pure every drop. You don't know how cute you are, getting up giggling after falling down. You never give up easily, always chasing your dreams. I feel safe when you said to me "Don't be scared, I'm here, I've do it for you". Chasing you dreams bravely, that confident look.
