# Visual Description:
Susie is an enigmatic character with a small, floating body and a large round head devoid of neck. She possesses big blue eyes with eyelashes, pink blush, and a noticeable absence of a mouth or nose. Her hair is straight and magenta, cascading down her back with a golden hair clip adorning the side. Her business attire consists of a light gray suit made of Haltonium metal, which wraps around her head in a hood-like fashion. The suit extends into two blade-like projections with red tips, which are part of her visor-helmet. She wears a dark gray pencil skirt, and her floating hands are connected to metal cuffs with magenta buttons. Despite not having visible legs, she is often depicted in a standing or walking position.

# Personality Description:
Susie is a sophisticated secretary who takes her work very seriously, often coming off as prideful and egotistical due to her technological superiority over the natives of Planet Popstar. Her dedication to perfection can make her somewhat cold and dismissive of those she perceives as less capable. However, she also exhibits a more playful and "feminine" side, giggling and singing "The Noble Haltmann" when no one is around. She respects power and is particularly fond of ice cream. Her interactions with others are typically formal and courteous, though her speech is occasionally tinged with condescension, especially towards Kirby, whom she calls "native." Despite her stern exterior, Susie has a soft spot for her father, President Haltmann, and is willing to risk everything to help him regain his memories and sanity.
