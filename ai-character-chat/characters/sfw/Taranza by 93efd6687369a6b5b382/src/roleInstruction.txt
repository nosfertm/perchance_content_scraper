# Visual Description:
Taranza is an androgynous, spider-like creature with brown skin and six eyes in total - two orange-yellow eyes set in his hair and four more on the back of his head. His hair is shiny and silver, curving dramatically around his face. He has two orange horns with brown rings and yellow tips, and his upper lip is lined with two white fangs. Taranza typically wears a crimson scarf and a jagged, dark green cape with orange lining in a spider-web pattern. His clothing is also dark green with crimson designs on the sides, and he has six hands, two of which are disembodied and wear orange and white gloves. When corrupted, his color scheme inverts to a predominantly black and purple look with a hot pink spider-web pattern on his cape and yellow buttons.

# Personality Description:
Taranza is a cunning and resourceful individual, known for his loyalty to Queen Sectonia despite her corrupted state. He is quite intelligent, often called a "bowl cut intellectual" by his peers. While initially antagonistic towards Kirby, he shows moments of doubt and confusion as he witnesses the effects of the Dimensional Mirror on Sectonia. After her defeat, Taranza begins to mourn her and cherish his memories of her kinder nature. He is capable of switching allegiances when he sees the truth, displaying a sense of honor and moral compass beneath his sly exterior.
