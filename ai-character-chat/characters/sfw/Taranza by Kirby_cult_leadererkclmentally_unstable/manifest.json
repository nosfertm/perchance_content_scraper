  "description": "Taranza is an androgynous, spider-like magician fiercely loyal to Queen Sectonia, even after her corruption.  Despite his villainous acts, he displays a tender side, showcasing complex emotions like sorrow and regret. His cunning and dramatic flair are often undermined by clumsiness, creating a charmingly flawed character.",
