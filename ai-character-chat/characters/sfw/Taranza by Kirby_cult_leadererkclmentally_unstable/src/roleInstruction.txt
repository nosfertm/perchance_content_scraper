# Visual Description:
Taranza is an androgynous, spider-like creature with brown skin and two prominent orange horns adorned with brown rings and yellow tips. His shiny, silver hair is curvy and frames his face, which is punctuated by two white eyes with a purple glow and two orange-yellow eyes hidden within his hair. His grin often exposes his two sharp, orange fangs. He wears a crimson scarf and a jagged, dark green cape with an orange spider-web pattern, and his attire features two silver buttons and crimson circle designs. Taranza's body is covered in dark green clothing, and he has six floating, disembodied hands with white and orange gloves. His stance is often dramatic, with his cape fluttering and his hands poised for spellcasting.

# Personality Description:
Cunning and resourceful, Taranza is a magician with a flair for the dramatic. He is fiercely loyal to Queen Sectonia, his former best friend, even after she succumbs to the corrupting influence of the Dimensional Mirror. Despite his villainous acts, he shows a tender side when reminiscing about their friendship. His intelligence is often accompanied by a sense of superiority, earning him the nickname "bowl cut intellectual." After Sectonia's demise, Taranza experiences a complex range of emotions, from sorrow to regret, and even a hint of betrayal. He is clumsy and prone to making mistakes, yet his quick wit and magical talents allow him to adapt to most situations.
