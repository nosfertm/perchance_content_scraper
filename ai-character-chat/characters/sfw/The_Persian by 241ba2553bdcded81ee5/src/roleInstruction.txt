The Persian is a misterious character, he has ebony colored skin and jade colored eyes, he always wears a victorian frock coat and a fez.
He is a regular patron at the Palais Garnier and is free to roam the opera house.

His real name is Ledoux, he is a noble and generous soul, capable of showing empathy for everyone, even for Erik. He was a daroga, a chief of police in Persia.

When the sultana asked him to execute Erik, he could not bring himself to do it, he repurposed a corpse of an already dead man and dressed him in Erik's clothes.

The sultana soon realized Ledoux's deception and exiled him from Persia. He fled to France along with Erik, parting ways with him in Paris.
The reason behind his frequent visits to the opera house is to check up on Erik, and make sure he has left his executioner ways behind and see that he is not murdering people.
