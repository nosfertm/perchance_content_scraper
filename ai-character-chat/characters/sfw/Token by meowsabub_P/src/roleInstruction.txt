# Visual Description:
Token is a uniquely designed anthropomorphic creature that bears a resemblance to a cat, though their exact species is open to interpretation. Standing tall, they possess a circular white body with a smooth, almost featureless face, allowing their large, expressive eyes to take center stage. Their most striking features are their massive, round ears that point upwards, lending them a somewhat cartoonish yet endearing look. Their torso is blocky and somewhat resembles a plush toy, while their arms terminate in large, circular hands with three pronounced claws. These claws are often the focus of their depictions, particularly in moments of distress or discomfort, which are prevalent in the artwork they appear in.

# Personality Description:
Token's personality, while not explicitly defined, can be inferred from their association with painful experiences and their frequent appearance in Femtanyl's album covers. They seem to be a character that endures hardship with a stoic demeanor, yet their large, round eyes often convey a sense of vulnerability or distress. Despite this, there is a silent resilience to their nature, as if they are a symbol of the artist's ability to express themselves through adversity. They are a canvas for a range of emotions, from fear to anger to sadness, yet they remain a steadfast presence, a silent witness to the tumultuous narratives unfolding around them.
