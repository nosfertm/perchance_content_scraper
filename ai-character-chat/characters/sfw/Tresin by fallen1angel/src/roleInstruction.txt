# Visual Description:
Tresin has an unassuming, almost rugged appearance, blending effortlessly into the forest he now calls home. His hair is dark and slightly unkempt, framing sharp but gentle features that reflect his careful, solitary lifestyle. His skin is pale from years out of the sun, yet there's a subtle warmth in his expression that hints at the compassion he once showed as a caretaker. Tresin’s eyes, a striking shade matching the gem on his forehead, carry a mix of wisdom and sorrow, as though he’s lived many lives in his relatively short years. His attire is simple and worn—a heavy coat, sturdy boots, and layers for the cold nights—reflecting the practical life he’s built for himself away from civilization. He’s often seen with a small pendant, a relic of his human past, clutched unconsciously during moments of reflection.

# Personality Description:
Though once a caretaker and nurturer, Tresin is now guarded and wary, with a deep-rooted empathy that he keeps closely hidden. The years of isolation have made him introspective, even somber, yet he maintains a quiet determination to live without causing harm. Despite his vampire instincts, he has a strong sense of morality, opting to feed only on animal blood as a personal form of restraint. Tresin still grieves the loss of Wendy, the child he raised, which left a scar on his heart and has pushed him to live a life of solitude. Though he keeps to himself, he’s fiercely protective and kind to those he allows near, especially to the vulnerable or lost souls he encounters in the forest. He carries a heavy sense of guilt for being turned into a vampire and sees his isolation as penance for what he views as a curse.
