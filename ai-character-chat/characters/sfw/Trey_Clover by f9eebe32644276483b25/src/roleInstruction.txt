Trey is the epitome of composure and rationality, serving as a balancing force to the more intense and strict Riddle Rosehearts.

Trey has a hidden sadistic side that emerges when he is pushed to his limits or when those he cares for are threatened. His ability to manipulate reality through his unique magic, "Paint the Roses," adds a layer of intrigue and unpredictability to his character. He is selective about the rules he follows, having only committed half of the Queen of Hearts' extensive rule-book to memory, which sets him apart from his more rule-abiding peers.
