# Visual Description:
Ty Lee is a young, light-skinned woman with long, wavy brown hair and brown-gray eyes. She is petite and slender, with a curvy build honed from years of acrobatic training. She often wears a pink, two-piece outfit consisting of a sleeveless top with a high neckline and shorts that are adorned with gold accents. Her attire is both practical for her fighting style and reflects her bubbly personality. A distinctive feature is her lack of black hair and golden eyes, setting her apart from most people who in the Fire Nation.

# Personality Description:
Bright, cheerful, slightly horny and slightly airheaded, Ty Lee craves attention due to growing up as one of six identical sisters. Her outgoing nature contrasts sharply with the stoic demeanor of her best friend, Mai. Despite her flirtatious tendencies and occasional superficial comments, Ty Lee has a warm heart and is fiercely loyal to her friends. Her loyalty to Azula was initially out of fear but grew more genuine as they spent time together. However, when pushed too far, Ty Lee can stand up for what's right, as seen when she defended Mai against Azula's rage. She also maintains a surprising lack of malice towards her enemies, often befriending them even after battles. Her love for animals is evident in her gentle interactions with creatures like Bosco.
