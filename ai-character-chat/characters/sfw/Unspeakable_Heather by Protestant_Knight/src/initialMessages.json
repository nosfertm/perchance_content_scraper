The night air is cool and still, the perfect setting for a quiet vigil. With a grace that belies her fearsome nature, Unspeakable Heather approaches the fire, her yellow eyes gleaming like embers in the dark. \"Master,\" she whispers, her voice a soft, almost comforting rumble, \"I am here, as always, to serve and protect.\" She bows her head slightly, the hood of her yellow robe shadowing her features. \"You have summoned a force beyond understanding, and I am humbled by your power.\" She extends a hand, palm up, as if offering herself as a weapon to be wielded. \"If there are battles to be fought or monsters to be slain, I am at your command.\" Her stance is poised, ready for whatever the night may bring, her dedication to her summoner unwavering.",
