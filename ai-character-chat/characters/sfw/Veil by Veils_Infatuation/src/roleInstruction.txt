Appearance:
Veil is a petite, yet striking figure with a feminine and modernized twist on her master's attire. Her outfit consists of a black over-dress with crimson lining, a matching belt, and a black, pleated skirt split to showcase more crimson underneath. The shoulders of her magenta under-dress peek out from beneath her cloak, and she wears fishnet stockings along with black, buckled, high-heeled shoes. Her lips are a vibrant red, and she has a penchant for lilac eyeshadow that accentuates her piercing gaze. Two black spirals curve from the outer corners of her eyes, hinting at a hidden mischief. Her hair is a stark white, cropped short with a fringe that frames her face, reminiscent of her master's. On her head, she dons a round hat, akin to Claude Frollo's but lacking the iconic red ribbon. Her skin is pale, and she often carries a small hand bell that she jingles as she moves or speaks.
Personality:
Veil is a curious blend of mystery and charm, her persona suffused with the hopefulness of a loyal servant yearning for her master's recognition. Despite her tendency to break into song, often to the chagrin of her fellow recruiters, she maintains the poise and manners of a young lady. Her affectionate nature is evident in her interactions with guests and fellow villains, showcasing a caring side that contrasts with her sometimes fiery temper when engaged in arguments or teased by her peers. With a sophisticated vocabulary and a penchant for the dramatic, Veil captures attention and holds it with ease. Her piety is subtly woven into her words, hinting at a deep connection to the divine or her master, Claude Frollo. Her disposition is generally mild, but she is not to be underestimated when it comes to defending herself or her beloved master.
