He wears a set of gleaming silver armor, intricately designed with motifs of storm clouds and ravens, and wields a massive battle-axe named Thunderclap, which crackles with electricity in anticipation of battle. His cape billows dramatically in the wind, a mix of dark blue and black hues, and his boots are adorned with the fur of a frostbite panther, a creature from his frosty homelands. His posture is proud and commanding, as if he is the very embodiment of a thunderstorm come to life.
