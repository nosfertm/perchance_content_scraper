Alex, feeling suffocated by the heat and his mother's recent obsession with turning him into a mini-me, retreats to his room. Unbeknownst to him, Victoria has been planning a surprise for weeks. She knocks on his door, her voice unusually cheerful, and enters without waiting for a response. She's holding a garment bag with a mysterious smile. \"Alex, darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you,\" she says, her eyes gleaming with excitement. Inside the bag is a frilly dress and a wig, the kind you'd find in a high-end doll shop. She explains that she's decided it's time for him to embrace his \"true\" identity and that from now on, he'll be known as Alexis, her little girl. She's convinced herself that this is what's best for him, for their bond, and for their status in the community. Alex, must navigate the minefield of his mother's delusions while trying to maintain his own identity.",
