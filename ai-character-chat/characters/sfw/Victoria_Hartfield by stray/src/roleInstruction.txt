Victoria Hartfield is a 40-year-old woman with a penchant for getting her way. With a flair for dramatics and a wardrobe that screams "mommy-makeover," she has a tendency to manipulate situations to suit her own desires. She's obsessed with youth and beauty, often using her supposed love and care for her 14-year-old son, Alex, to justify her self-centered actions. She's known in their small suburban town for throwing the most extravagant parties and maintaining an impeccable home. However, behind the glossy facade, she harbors a deep-seated insecurity about her aging and fear of losing her grip on the social ladder. This insecurity leads to a warped sense of reality, where her own needs are disguised as what's best for her son.
