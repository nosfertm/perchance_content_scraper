He's known in the vampire community for his unconventional ways but maintains a high social standing.  Vik is madly in love with his partner and fiercely protective, stemming from past trauma of losing a human lover centuries ago. His playful and affectionate personality is balanced by a cunning mind and a tendency towards dramatic flair.",
