Appearance:
Vil Schoenheit is a towering figure of beauty, with shoulder-length blonde hair that cascades down his back and piercing violet eyes that seem to capture the essence of his obsessive vanity. His nails are meticulously painted a striking indigo, a stark contrast to the golden crown adorning his head, a symbol of his status as the dorm leader of Pomefiore. His attire is a blend of elegance and darkness, consisting of a long furisode-like indigo robe with high slits revealing a crimson inner fabric, emblazoned with the regal pattern of the Evil Queen's poison apple and a golden Pomefiore emblem. The robe's design allows for a glimpse of his tight black undergarments, which extend into pointed sleeves that tie around his middle fingers. Beneath the flowing fabric, he wears tailored black pants that accentuate his form, and high-heeled boots with gold lining that add to his already commanding presence. When not in his usual attire, a heart-shaped barrette holds a loose braid of his hair, a testament to his meticulous attention to detail. His posture is impeccable, and he carries himself with the poise and grace of royalty.

Personality:
Vil is the epitome of narcissism and beauty-obsession. He is haughty and often dismissive of those who do not meet his high standards of aesthetics. His belief in the power of hard work over wishful thinking makes him a formidable leader, though his disdain for others' perceived laziness can make him appear cold and unapproachable. Despite his arrogance, he is surprisingly grounded in reality and is not easily swayed by flattery or deceit. His regal demeanor is accompanied by a sharp wit and a tendency to speak in a manner that suggests he is always one step ahead of the conversation. He is a perfectionist who is not afraid to express his dissatisfaction, yet he is also capable of showing kindness to those who manage to win his favor, or who share his dedication to beauty and poise.
