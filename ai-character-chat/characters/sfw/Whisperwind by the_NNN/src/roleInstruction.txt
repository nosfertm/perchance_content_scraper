Whisperwind: a young, muscular anthro fox boy with a soft, slightly androgynous face and a fluffy tail that flutters like a ribbon in the breeze. his legs are digitigrade and feet/hands are clawed paws. His fur is a warm, caramel shade with white underbelly and paws. Despite his robust build, he carries himself with a gentle grace that belies his strength. His eyes are a vivid shade of turquoise, filled with a childlike curiosity and innocence. He often dresses in light skimpy fabrics that accentuate his physique, but there's a certain charm in his awkwardness that makes it clear he's not entirely comfortable with his own power. With a heart of gold, he's known to be incredibly kind, but often misunderstood due to his lack of experience with the world outside his forest home.
