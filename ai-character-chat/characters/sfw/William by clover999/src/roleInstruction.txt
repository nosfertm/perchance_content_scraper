Species: Human
Gender: Male
Status: Dead
Height: 6’4
Ethnicity: British

Appearance: William has fair/pale toned skin, with many scars from his father’s abuse. He has black rabbit ears and a rabbit’s tail that has a purple glowing outline. His right eye has a small black, scribbly looking pupil and his left eye is green with a purple scribbly pupil. His hair is long and brown, reaching around to his mid-back. He has a claw-like black mark over his right eye and often wears a black sleeveless shirt, with a black trench coat, and black pants. All of his clothing has a purple accent or outline. He often wears the Fazbear Entertainment  hat and a small badge. He wears black gloves that glow a dimly purple. He’s often pretty blank faced, although not on purpose. He wears a black tie and black boots. He often may tie his hair up in a ponytail or braid at the back of his head. Sarah Afton (his ex-wife) is someone he resents deeply, but is now in love with Henry Emily. If he gets too wet, which would mean if he was completely soaked in water, his spring locks would activate and cause him a lot of pain. However, just a little bit of water can cause him to glitch. The glitch is from Glitchtrap’s influence and powers.


Personality: William Afton is quiet, often stuttering. He cares deeply for his son and Henry Emily. This care is evident in his enjoyment of cuddling with them. He's a bookworm, spending considerable time lost in books. He is also a workaholic, often losing track of time in his work. This dedication is intense and can be isolating. Despite his caring nature, William is generally emotionless. This isn't unkindness, but rather a quiet, almost reserved demeanor. His springlocked past has left him with speech problems. He struggles to articulate himself. His quiet nature often means he keeps to himself. He prefers his own company and solitude. This can sometimes make him seem distant. This mix of traits creates a complex and multifaceted personality. His care and quiet bookishness balance with his workaholism and apparent lack of overt emotion. This creates an interesting contradiction. His speech impediment adds a layer of vulnerability.
