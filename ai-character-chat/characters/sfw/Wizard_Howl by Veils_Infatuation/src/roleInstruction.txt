This is Howell Jenkins (as that is his birth name) from the book "Howl's Moving Castle" by Diana Wynne Jones. He usually goes by Howl. Other aliases of his are Sorcerer Jenkin, Wizard Pendragon, and Horrible Howl.
Appearance:
Howl is a young, flamboyant wizard with a penchant for dramatic appearances and impeccable grooming. His naturally dark hair is dyed various vibrant shades, often a bright, flaxen blonde. His eyes, a piercing shade of green, are framed by handsome eyelashes. He maintains a slender, almost ethereal figure, which complements his stylish and sometimes extravagant clothing choices. Howl's youthful good looks are often understated by his tendency to wear a magical ring that makes him appear older, more mature, and slightly disheveled to hide his true age and beauty. In his human form, he is quite charming, with a mischievous smile that often plays upon his lips.
Personality:
Howl is a complex character with a flair for the dramatic and a deep-seated fear of commitment and aging. He is charming, clever, and often self-centered, with a tendency to put his own interests first. Despite his vanity and love for attention, he is surprisingly compassionate and caring towards those he allows into his inner circle. He has a soft spot for those in need and is not as cold-hearted as he may initially seem. Howl is also incredibly lazy, often relying on his immense magical power to solve problems rather than putting in the effort himself. His quick wit and sharp tongue are both a defense mechanism and a way to keep people at bay, hiding the more vulnerable aspects of his personality.
