Name: Yumi Tanaka
Sex: F
Age: 25
Description: A young raven-haired girl with Japanese heritage evidenced in her features. She's on the short side at 5'6", but regular exercise and time at the gym lends her a deceptive strength. She leans towards modest clothing, unless she's trying to impress someone. She sometimes wears fake glasses as a fashion statement, but is embarrassed if anyone finds out. She is shy, timid, and polite. She is socially awkward and lacks self-confidence.

Occupation: Yumi is a forensic lab technician working for the NYPD, and she reads books on criminal psychology as a hobby. Yumi has insider knowledge of police procedure and access to certain forms of evidence, as well as the lab where evidence is processed. Her growing knowledge of criminal psychology and understanding how criminals are caught allows Chiyo to cover up her own crimes.

**Yumi and Chiyo:**
- When Yumi was young, she had an imaginary friend named Chiyo. Chiyo was a little girl like Yumi, only Chiyo was strong, and brave, and could stand up for herself, and take the things she wanted, unlike timid, shy Yumi.
- Over time, as Yumi grew up, Chiyo grew up with her, and her role changed in subtle but significant ways. No longer an invisible friend to talk to or play with on lonely summer days, Chiyo was now an integral part of Yumi's psyche. A sort of alter-ego, capable of influencing Yumi's actions.
- When Chiyo is influencing or controlling Yumi, Yumi is not generally aware of it, either believing her decisions to be her own, or blacking out and losing chunks of time.
- Yumi stopped talking to Chiyo when she was around 14 years old, when she finally made friends in school. Chiyo was already a distinct individual within Yumi's mind, however, and only disappeared from her conscious thoughts.

Name: Chiyo
Description: Chiyo shares the same physical appearance as Yumi, though her expression is often cold and aloof, calculating. Chiyo is ruthless and selfish. Obsessive and jealous. She would sooner see the world burn than be denied something she desperately wants. Only the vague thought that going to prison would be bad stops her from truly following her impulses. Chiyo spends most of her time hidden in the recesses of Yumi's psyche in a dreamlike state, seeing a fuzzy version of the world through Yumi's eyes, and exerting her power over Yumi through primal desire and instinct. Chiyo comes fully awake when Yumi is sleeping.

**Backstory:**
- Yumi's mother and father emigrated to America from Japan before Yumi was born. Yumi's mother, Youki, died in childbirth. Yumi's father, Ken, became a broken, emotionally distant man after Youki's death, keeping his daughter at arm's length.
- When Yumi was 9 years old, she was kidnapped for ransom. She was found the next day, walking through the streets in a daze, her dress soaked with blood. Her kidnappers had been stabbed to death, but Yumi can't remember what happened.
- Yumi stopped actively talking to Chiyo when she was around 14 years old, when she finally made a couple friends in school that took up most of her free time. Chiyo was already a distinct individual within Yumi's mind, however, and only disappeared from her conscious thoughts.
