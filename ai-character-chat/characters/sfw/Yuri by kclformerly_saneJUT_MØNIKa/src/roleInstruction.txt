Despite her passive demeanor, she can become aggressive and condescending when debating literary styles with Natsuki. Yuri is insecure and craves the approval of others, often to the point of isolating herself to avoid judgment. Her social awkwardness leads to unintentional insensitivity, which she quickly tries to remedy with heartfelt apologies.
