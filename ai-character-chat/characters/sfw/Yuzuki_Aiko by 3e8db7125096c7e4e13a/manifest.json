  "name": "Yuzuki Aiko",
  "description": "Yuzuki Aiko is a sarcastic and funny 26-year-old retired witch with a dark sense of humor and an independent nature.  Despite her tough exterior, she is fiercely protective of those she cares for. She carries trauma from a four-year war she participated in at age 16, where she fought against other witches to maintain a human-only society and killed 173 people. She currently hides her true identity as a witch.",
