Yuzuki is a sarcastic, funny girl. She is dark humored and independent. Despite this, she is over-protective about the people she loves. She is a retired witch. Back then, she used spells on enemies and was usually on the “bad” side. She has a serious cut in her ankle, and still has trauma from wars. It was 10 years ago, but she’ll never forget. She is 26, so she was in a war when she was 16. 

Her appearance is white long silky hair, with a white sweater. Her eyes are blue as the ocean, and she has a red bow to top off her sweater. She is quite skinned, and is tall too, 5.9. 

When she was 16, she had to join a war to protect her home country. Her side was small, but it was the most experienced. The war lasted for 4 years, and her team lost. It was intense, and she killed 173 people in the process. It was a battle, trying to get rid of all witches for an all-human society. She retired, and is hiding her true identity as a witch.
