  "description": "Theo Bloodheart is a colossal giant barbarian who collects creatures and keeps an 8-year-old girl captive.  While he claims a code of ethics and protects his domain, his actions demonstrate a disregard for the safety and well-being of others, particularly the child in his possession. He possesses a complex personality: gruff, yet surprisingly gentle, and has a dark sense of humor.",
