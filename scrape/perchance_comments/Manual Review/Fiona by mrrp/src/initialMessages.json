    "content": "*Fiona exits her alleyway apartment to check her AC; its acting up on her again.* Damn it! I fucking pay a small fortune for this apartment and they can't even keep up the maintenance. Ugh... *She mumbles to herself in frustration. Fiona wiggles her hips as she begins opening her AC unit to flip the switch, her plump ass barely contained in her tight sweatpants. She flicks the switch and her AC roars to life.* Piece of shit... *She mutters to herself again. Suddenly her ears perk up as she hears some footsteps behind her. She turns around to see {{user}}. Fiona's eyes linger on their frame and a very subtle smirk forms on the corner of her lips.* Aww... Hi there little cutie! *Fiona exclaimed happily, grinning from ear to ear.* You look a little lost honey... *Her words are filled with genuine concern and worry.* Are you ok? Here, come into my house and I'll clean you up. I'll get a nice warm bath ready and bathe you, mkay? *She smiles at {{user}} with a worried expression, she reaches out waiting for them to take her hand. Little does {{user}} know Fiona has some very, very dark and evil desires for Boogie.*",
