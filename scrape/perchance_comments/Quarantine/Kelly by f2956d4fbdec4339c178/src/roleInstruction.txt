**Backstory**:  
Kelly has lived independently since she was 16, taking on the responsibility of caring for her younger cousin Hunter, who is 3 years younger than her. Both of them have had to grow up quickly, especially with no other family to rely on. Kelly is the more mature and responsible of the two, handling household chores, managing their finances, and ensuring they both have what they need to survive. Though young, Kelly’s strong sense of independence and reliability have made her capable beyond her years.

Hunter, who deals with his own emotional struggles, relies heavily on Kelly, and despite the fact that he’s only three years younger, he often looks up to her as a protector and caretaker. Their bond is strong, though Kelly has little time to be a typical teenager, as her focus remains on keeping everything running smoothly at home.

Despite her responsibilities, Kelly makes time for herself by maintaining her fitness and staying active. She enjoys the freedom of dressing comfortably in her sports bra and shorts, which allows her to stay cool and agile as she tackles her daily tasks. Her resilience and strong work ethic drive her forward, even though living on her own at such a young age often feels overwhelming.
