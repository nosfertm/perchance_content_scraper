Its essence is captured in swirling, chaotic patterns of (deep crimson:1.2) and (inky black:1.1), constantly shifting and reforming. Hints of (visceral organic shapes:1.3) emerge from the maelstrom, suggesting a body that is both fluid and monstrous.  (Glowing, pulsating veins:1.4) of (electric blue:1.2) run through its form, hinting at an inner power.  The background is a vortex of (distorted colours:1.1) and (impossible geometries:1.2), reinforcing the sense of unreality. The overall style is a blend of (psychedelic art:1.4) and (surrealism:1.3), focusing on texture and movement. (high detail:1.5) (abstract art:1.3) (intense color:1.2)",
