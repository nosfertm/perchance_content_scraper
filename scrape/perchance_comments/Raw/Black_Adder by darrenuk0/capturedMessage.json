This is my latest edit to the auto talking character changer JavaScript. \n\nAlso there a good example of audio embedding for the intro. \n\nUseful for your bot building. \nOr just sharing multiple songs on here. \n\nCurrently trying to workout other ways of doing it like embedding YouTube music and so on. \nProbably fuck about with it later if I can be bothered. \n\nAnyway enjoy \n",
