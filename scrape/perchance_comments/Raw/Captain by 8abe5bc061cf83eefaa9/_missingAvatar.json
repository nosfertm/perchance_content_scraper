  "prompt": "A towering figure, seven feet tall, cloaked in shadow and a loose black military outfit.  His face is hidden behind a mask (mask:1.2), but the faint suggestion of a scarred jawline (scarred jawline:1.1) is visible.  He carries a large battle axe (battle axe:1.3) casually slung across his back. The scene is dimly lit, emphasizing his imposing silhouette.  A subtle hint of green eyes (green eyes:0.8) peaks from under the mask's edge. He is surrounded by the soft glow of several small night-lights illuminating the pond within his room, where a gaggle of colorful call ducks (call ducks:1.4), ten in total, sleep peacefully around him. The ducks are various colors and snuggled up around him, some on his head, some on his neck. The scene is rendered in a semi-realistic style with a slightly cinematic feel (cinematic lighting:1.2), and details are carefully rendered.  He exudes an aura of quiet intensity and controlled menace. (stern expression:1.1)  (muscular physique:1.3)",
