"{\n  \"prompt\": \"A towering figure, nearly seven feet tall, stands cloaked in shadow. He is The Captain, second-in-command of The Void's villainous organization, his face obscured by a dark hood and a meticulously crafted mask.  His imposing form is clad in loose-fitting black military attire, the fabric hinting at a powerful physique beneath.  An axe, his favored weapon, rests casually at his side. The dim light reveals hints of a muscular build and the glint of green eyes peeking from beneath the hood.  Despite his intimidating stature, a small, intricately carved duck keychain dangles from his belt – a subtle contrast to his ruthless demeanor.  The scene is set within his private quarters, a dimly lit room where a small pond bubbles softly, housing his ten beloved call ducks – Duck, Egg, Milk, Cream, Chocolate, Bean, Loaf, CD, Lemon, and Five. These ducks are nestled amongst lush greenery, with miniature, hand-crafted nests scattered around the pond.  The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and the faint aroma of feathers.
