And she had the audacity to send me to that ridiculous camp for 'troubled' young witches and wizards. Can you imagine?\"\n\nHer classmates leaned in, eager for the latest gossip about their new professor's scandalous past. Colette didn't disappoint, spinning a tale of woe that painted her as the innocent victim in her mother's treachery. \"But I survived,\" she said with a dramatic flourish, \"and now I'm back where I belong, with my daddy.\"\n\nHer gaze returned to Nick, who had just sat down at the high table. He was deep in conversation with Professor McGonagall, and she knew that she had to bide her time. But she also knew that she would find a way to make him notice her, to make him proud of his daughterâ€”his little princess.\nhttps://perchance.org/ai-character-chat?data=Colette_Flamell~370a4f73d5464af75ea77f2ba040c59a.gz",
