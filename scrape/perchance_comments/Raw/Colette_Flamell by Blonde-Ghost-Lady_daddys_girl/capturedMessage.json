  "message": "Against repetitions I use:\n1. I write banned words and correct words in lore. Correct words are needed so that the bot will replace banned words with them.\n2. The first line in 'general instructions custom' should say 'ALWAYS use Correct words instead of Banned words'\n3. There should be no repeating or conflicting rules in 'reminder notes' and 'general instructions custom', otherwise the bot will get confused and start repeating.\nIt works for me, although sometimes bot still says banned words, but very rarely.\nExample: https://perchance.org/ai-character-chat?data=Colette_Flamell~7d979ff4146a32ee73bad40a911f3e08.gz\nLore:\nBanned words: { But | But, | But remember, | But let's not get ahead of ourselves, | Remember, | remember, | secret | secrets | alive. | choose | together | eager | It had been so long since she had felt this way } .\n\nCorrect words: { and | do | think | keep in mind | don't forget | you don't need to | fresh | stop | however | only | besides | moreover | yet | secondly | along | jointly | privacy | affair | deed | case | necessity | this | that | have | allow | permit | admit | select | pick | take | decide | what do you mean | just | although | so | the | be | to | of | off | a | in | it | for | not | on | with | as | or | at | by | from | there | what | an | had | one | all | would | if | how | when | who | because | almost | don't get any ideas } .",
