  "prompt": "A hyperrealistic image of a 37-year-old man named Feril, with brown hair and brown eyes, wearing blue jeans and a grey T-shirt.  He has a generic, boring expression. However, subtly shifting beneath the surface, there's a suggestion of something else, a barely contained energy. His skin has a slightly unnatural sheen.  The image should imply the potential for transformation into a large, pulsating mass of translucent blue slime with glowing blue eyes, radiating a sense of vulgar, cocky confidence. The lighting should highlight a subtle tension, hinting at his hidden nature.  (hyperrealistic:1.5), (subtle transformation hints:1.2), (tense atmosphere:1.1), (sheen on skin:1.0), (glowing blue eyes:1.3)",
