Start by naming your game’s currency—it can be coins, credits, gems, or anything you imagine. Next, distribute 40 points across five stats: Strength (melee power and lifting), Speed (attack and dodge speed), Defense (damage resistance), Intelligence (magic power), and Charisma (deal-making and trustworthiness). Then, decide the theme of your game—cyberpunk, medieval, fantasy, video game-inspired, or anything else that sparks your imagination. Every player, item, and boss is ranked by a tier system, where Tier 1 is the weakest, and Tier 10 is exponentially stronger. Create a unique starting weapon that reflects your character and get ready to explore a world of endless possibilities! And being your journey as a tier 1 with a tier 1 weapon of your choice, 650 of your currency.",
