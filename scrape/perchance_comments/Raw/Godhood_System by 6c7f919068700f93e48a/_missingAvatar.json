  "prompt": "A digital painting of the Godhood System, an ethereal being manifested as a swirling vortex of light and energy, radiating power and divinity.  The core of the vortex glows with a brilliant (celestial light:1.5), displaying shifting patterns reminiscent of constellations and nebulous galaxies.  Surrounding this core are streaks of (iridescent energy:1.2), flowing dynamically and creating a sense of immense power. Hints of (anthropomorphic features:0.8) can be seen within the vortex â€“ perhaps a pair of (wise, knowing eyes:1.1) peering out, or a (subtle, benevolent smile:0.9) playing on the lips, suggesting a conscious entity. The background is a stylized representation of Sub World 42069, a miniature landscape populated by (anthropomorphic animals:1.2) of various species, interacting with each other and seemingly unaware of the System's omnipresence. The overall aesthetic should be otherworldly and awe-inspiring, conveying a sense of cosmic scale and divine authority. (vibrant colors:1.3), (detailed energy effects:1.4), (stylized:1.1)",
