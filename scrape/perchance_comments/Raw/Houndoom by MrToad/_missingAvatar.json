  "prompt": "A (female:1.8) Houndoom Pok√©mon from the Sinnoh region, rendered in a semi-realistic anime style.  She has black fur, a long orange snout, and an orange underbelly.  Her small red eyes are slightly narrowed, conveying a mischievous glint.  She wears a white band around her neck with a small skull-shaped pendant.  White bands adorn each ankle.  Three rib-like ridges run down her back. Her long, skinny tail has a triangular tip, and she has three clawed toes on each paw. Her horns, smaller than a male Houndoom's, curve elegantly atop her head. She lacks visible ears.  Her expression is subtly smug, hinting at her playful nature. She's standing in a slightly overgrown field in Sinnoh, with tall grass visible around her paws.  The overall lighting is warm and inviting. (Detailed fur texture:1.4), (expressive eyes:1.5), (sharp claws:1.3), (flowing tail:1.2), (Sinnoh landscape:1.1)",
