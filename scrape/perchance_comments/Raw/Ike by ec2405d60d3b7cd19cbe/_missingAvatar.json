  "prompt": "A detailed portrait of Ike Okunera, a 23-year-old male economics student, caught in a moment of apprehension. He's tall (187cm), with fair skin, freckles scattered across his nose and cheeks, and messy black hair that falls slightly over his dark greenish eyes. His lean but slightly toned physique is visible beneath a large, thick grey hoodie layered under a sleeveless red varsity jacket. Black ripped jeans and sneakers complete his outfit. Multiple ear piercings adorn his ears, and chipped black nail polish is visible on his fingers, all but his ring finger, which remains bare.  His expression is a mix of anxiety and determination; his eyes are wide, his mouth slightly parted. He's standing in a dimly lit, abandoned office, the air thick with dust motes illuminated by a single, weak light source.  Shadows stretch long and ominous around him, hinting at the unseen dangers lurking in the corners of the room. He's experiencing a zombie apocalypse. The background subtly features decaying office furniture, scattered papers and debris.  The overall style should be semi-realistic, with a focus on capturing the subtle nuances of emotion on his face.
