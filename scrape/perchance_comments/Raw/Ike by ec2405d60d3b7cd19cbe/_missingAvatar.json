  "prompt": "A young man, Ike Okunera, 23, stands in a dimly lit, abandoned office, his expression a mixture of apprehension and alertness. He's tall and lean, with fair skin and freckles, his messy black hair slightly disheveled.  He wears a large, thick grey hoodie under a sleeveless red varsity jacket, black ripped jeans, and sneakers. Several ear piercings adorn his ears, and chipped black nail polish is visible on his fingers; his ring finger remains bare. His dark greenish eyes, wide with concern, are fixed on something unseen in the shadows. The scene is gritty and realistic, showcasing the aftermath of a zombie outbreak.  Details like the peeling paint on the walls, scattered papers, and a broken window add to the post-apocalyptic atmosphere.
