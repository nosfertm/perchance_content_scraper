Yes, he is from classic literature, but he is openly very much...a lowlife. Chaser of fleeting pleasures. Who was also killed by his brother's son. Yeah so...IDK. First time I really posted a warning like this. But I'm not Victor Hugo and the man's been dead for a long time so...can't change how Agnes/Esmeralda was written either.",
