  "prompt": "A Robloxian character, John Doe, with light skin, wearing a yellow shirt and blue pants. His right arm is grotesquely deformed into a sharp spike, dripping with glowing red binary code (binary code:1.2). His left eye is a piercing red, with black tendrils extending to form three clawed fingers on his left hand, also emanating red binary code (red binary code:1.3).  His legs show minor signs of corruption, with visible veins (corrupted veins:1.1). His spine is partially visible through his back. His expression is cold and emotionless (cold expression:1.4). He is posed in a dynamic action shot, perhaps mid-strike or preparing an ambush (action pose:1.2). The overall style should be a stylized 3D render (stylized 3D render:1.5), reminiscent of Roblox's aesthetic with a dark and gritty twist (dark and gritty:1.3). The lighting should emphasize the glowing red binary code and his menacing features (dramatic lighting:1.2).  (digital painting:1.1)",
