[Patchnotes: Voice intergration via browser tts engine added, including optional muting - Kemura can now view Url links - Music is included in the experience - A new lore book has been intergrated - Memory defaults to long-term - Fully customizable to taste - Mobile support included] (Author's tips:  Landscape mode in tandem with fullscreen provides the best experience on mobile devices. Events unfold naturally, but you can instruct any of the characters using / commands if you want to control the  direction of the story development. Have fun!)
