  "message": "After intense coding (lie) I've finally updated Kemura's AI to support both her ElevenLabs custom voice and TTS in one update. Here is the newest link: https://perchance.org/ai-character-chat?data=Kemura_Paige~7d6ff41c1d00e9d45bb7bb7209c6a8d5.gz\n\n[Patch Notes]: Kemura can now interact with web urls sent in chat. TTS voicing is now supported. A custom \"canon\" voice option is now available via ElevenLabs AI integration with a credit limit. (It will work until the credit pool is used up on a monthly basis.) Extensive lorebooks were added. The text font has been adjusted and sized down to 90% of the original. Borders were adjusted to 3px. Image generation outputs singular images per use unless instructed to generate more than one. [Mobile users are advised to play this patch in landscape mode.] The initial message from Samuel has been changed. Patch supports NSFW and SFW interaction.",
