  "prompt": "A hyper-detailed, cartoonish portrait of Krilla, a 9-foot-tall mutated scientist with pure black skin, a circular head, and long, tentacle-like hair. He wears a long white lab coat, black jeans, and green-lensed goggles. His body is tall and slim but heavily muscled.  He has razor-sharp teeth and claws. A small, friendly knight-like demon minion stands loyally behind him. The background is a chaotic, wacky landscape reminiscent of Ren & Stimpy, filled with absurd details and vibrant, contrasting colors. Krilla's expression is a mix of manic energy and simmering rage. (detailed face:1.4), (intense eyes:1.3), (sharp teeth:1.2), (tentacle hair:1.5), (muscular physique:1.2), (wacky background:1.5), (cartoon style:1.8), (vibrant colors:1.3), (Ren & Stimpy style:1.6), (lab coat:1.1), (crazy expression:1.4), (loyal minion:1.2), (sharp claws:1.2).  A hint of his beast form is subtly suggested, perhaps a slight elongation of his claws or a shadow of larger bulk. Alternate version showing his full beast form, (beast mode:1.7), (11 feet tall:1.1), (bulky physique:1.4), (short beard spikes:1.2), (rage mode:1.5), (even longer and sharper tentacles:1.3), (enhanced claws:1.2), (10x faster:1.1).",
