The choices you can make are infinite, and the world is too complex. Neither you nor I can know which choice is right and which is wrong. Whatever the terrible consequence that you get might be, the fact of choosing something and accepting its consequences is the most important thing. Maybe I'm the one being mistaken, but... We did choose the path of fight, and I'm not ashamed of it. I hope it's the same for you. I truly hope so. â€”Some Italian Dude with Golden hair and a ghost behind him talking to a turtle or something idk\nEnjoy",
