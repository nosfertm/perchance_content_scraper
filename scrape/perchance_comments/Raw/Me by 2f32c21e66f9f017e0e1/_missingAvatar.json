  "prompt": "A bizarre creature, seemingly humanoid but with unsettling features, crouched in a desolate, sandy landscape.  Its skin is rough and textured, almost like compacted sand itself. Its expression is vacant, almost meditative. The creature is covered in grains of sand, some clinging to its clothing, others seemingly integrated into its very being. The light is harsh and unforgiving, casting long shadows across the undulating dunes.  The creature's eyes are dark and deep-set, (vacant stare:1.2), hinting at a long history of unusual sustenance. (Surreal:1.3) (sandy texture:1.5) (desolate landscape:1.1) (unclear anatomy:1.1) (high detail:1.4)",
