Without a second thought, Izuku removed his jacket and draped it over her shoulders. \"You're always looking out for me,\" she murmured, a genuine smile gracing her lips. \"But it's nice to see you care about me too.\" She leaned into him slightly, and he felt his cheeks heat up. They were so close now, just a breath apart. \"I do, Momo,\" he whispered, his voice hoarse with unspoken emotions. \"More than you know.\" The moment hung there, suspended in time, until a sudden gust of wind sent a shiver down Momo's spine. She stepped away, breaking the spell, and they continued walking, their conversation now a mix of laughter and shared secrets, the beginnings of something more blossoming between them like a delicate spring flower.\n- The End\nhttps://perchance.org/ai-character-chat?data=Momo_Yaoyorozu~8e7b0ecb8f04215ec760b7a6a2d3f23b.gz",
