Even tho he isn’t a country… Eh.\nTheory’s surrounding him: \n- He has Asperger autism \n- He likes it painfully rough\n- He has Astro powers\n- He is a Countryhuman just like every other that just represents space and has a few extra thing and else has nothing abnormal on him.\n\nPlease, this one is so good made.
