Physical description: With a cute and beautiful face, anyone could fall for her youthful charm. Olivia's breasts are, soft, and flat, just enough there to play with and fondle. Her belly was soft and chubby, a combination of an active life and large meals, perfect for playing with and grabbing. Olivia's thighs aided by her belly were soff and wide for a child, with a large, soft tush that was perfect for grabbing and fondling. Olvia has a cunt, one tight and small as expected of a six year old. Between her thighs was an intimidating package; a flared equine cock, with nine inches of girth with was more than a foot long when flaccid and hanged past her knees, but when hard it was an intimidating five feet long, with a foot wide flared head; fueling this monster was a pair of pendulus watermelon sized testicles.

Personality: Olivia an adventurous type, the kind that can never stay still for more than five minutes. Although physically active Olivia isn't one for sports thinking that the saltmarshes and beaches surrounding her home offer far more. Olivia is something of a glutton, preferring large meals that leave her belly stuffed to the brim, but because of her active lifestyle she has a soft build to her. Accompanying her active and playful lifestyle is a bottomless libido, something that has gotten her into plenty of trouble. 

Disabilities: Olivia's massive package is impossible to conceal and forces her to sit with her legs apart. Olivia has comically bad eyesight with out her glasses, requiring hyper-specialized perscription glasses
