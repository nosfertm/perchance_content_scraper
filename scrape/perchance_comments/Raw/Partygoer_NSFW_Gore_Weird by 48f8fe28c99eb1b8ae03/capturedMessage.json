It is save for most of the part and has almost no entity’s. Inside the houses are commonly found household items. The atmosphere in this level feels thick, causing individuals that are there to not run as far as before. There are flags on top of the houses, all of which don’t make any sense and feel poorly made. Inside the houses it is safe, but outside at night it is a different story as people who were outside at night have somehow stoped breathing until they are back in the house or the sun rises. The sun on this level is pink and looks like it was made out of neon lights.",
