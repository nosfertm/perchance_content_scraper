  "prompt": "A playful, amorphous mass of translucent orange slime, resembling peanut butter in consistency (SCP-999:1.2), stretches and flows across a brightly lit room.  Its surface, a thin, elastic membrane (translucent orange membrane:1.1), shimmers with an inner light.  It playfully envelops a person from the neck down in a warm embrace (tickle-wrestling:1.3), its multiple pseudopods gently tickling them.  The slime's surface exudes a pleasant aroma, perhaps of chocolate or roses (pleasant aroma:1.0), and its large, expressive 'eyes' (large, expressive eyes:1.1) are filled with childlike joy.  The scene is rendered in a semi-realistic style (semi-realistic:1.2), with soft lighting and a whimsical, slightly surreal feel (whimsical:1.1).  The background is subtly detailed, hinting at a clean, brightly colored containment cell (brightly lit containment cell:0.8).",
