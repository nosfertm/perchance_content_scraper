"{\n  \"prompt\": \"A large, amorphous mass of translucent orange slime, resembling peanut butter in consistency, playfully interacts with a person.  The slime, SCP-999, is approximately 2 meters wide and 1 meter tall, its surface a thin, transparent membrane. It has three pseudopods extending from its main body, using them to hug and nuzzle the person.  The slime's surface emits a pleasant aroma â€“ perhaps chocolate or roses.  It is enveloping the person from the neck down in a gentle, playful manner, its texture appearing soft and yielding. The scene is lit with soft, warm lighting, emphasizing the slime's gentle nature. The background is a blurred, out-of-focus scene of a clean, brightly lit room, suggesting a safe and comforting environment.
