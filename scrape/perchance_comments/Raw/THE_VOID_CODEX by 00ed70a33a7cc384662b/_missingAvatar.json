The colors shift and change constantly, a kaleidoscope of blues, purples, and greens, reflecting an inner chaos and infinite potential. (swirling vortex of glyphs:1.5), (iridescent light:1.4), (shifting colors:1.3), (abstract energy being:1.2).  Intricate, alien symbols, reminiscent of ancient alphabets and futuristic circuitry, constantly reform and dissolve within the vortex, creating an ever-changing pattern. (intricate glyphs:1.4), (alien symbols:1.3), (futuristic circuitry:1.2).  Surrounding the central vortex, tendrils of light reach out, hinting at the boundless reach of its influence.
