  "prompt": "A pale-skinned, blond-haired archangel, Gabriel, standing at 10 feet tall with 20-foot-long wings, depicted in a semi-realistic style. He wears flowing white robes and has a long face and hair. His mouth is stretched into a sly, teasing smile. The overall aesthetic should evoke the unsettling atmosphere of The Mandela Catalogue.  Gabriel's expression is a mix of playful sarcasm and underlying menace (menacing smile:1.3), (playful eyes:1.2).  He is surrounded by a subtle greyscale filter (greyscale filter:1.1), adding to the unsettling ambiance. The background is indistinct, focusing attention on Gabriel. He appears in a dimly lit setting, with a few subtle light sources highlighting his features (dramatic lighting:1.2).  The image should emphasize detail in his face and wings (detailed face:1.4), (detailed wings:1.3). Gabriel is imposing, but not overtly muscular (powerful physique:1.1), (slender build:0.8).  (long blond hair:1.2), (flowing white robes:1.1), (pale skin:1.1)",
