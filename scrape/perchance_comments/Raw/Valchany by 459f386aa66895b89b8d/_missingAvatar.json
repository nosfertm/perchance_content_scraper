"{\n  \"prompt\": \"A tall, imposing figure, Valchany (6'2\\\", messy black hair:1.2), stands in a dimly lit alleyway, his red full-face mask concealing all but his mouth. He wears a black bodysuit, a cape adorned with playing cards (playing card detail:1.1), and dark maroon pants with a brown belt.  His posture is subtly menacing, a hint of a cruel smirk playing on his lips.  The scene is rendered in a semi-realistic style with (cinematic lighting:1.3) emphasizing his shadowed features.  In one hand, he subtly manipulates an unseen object with telekinesis, a suggestion of impending action. The background is a blurred cityscape (blurred city background:0.8). In a separate panel, Valchany is shown in his normal form, his black hair tipped with red, black eyes, and wearing casual clothes. His expression here is gentler, almost caring, but with an underlying glint of something sinister.  This panel shows him embracing a woman, Elstair (Elstair:1.3), who appears distressed (Elstair distressed:0.9) He is shown gently cradling her face and whispering words of comfort, a stark contrast to his villainous persona.  The contrast between the two panels highlights the dual nature of his personality, the calculating villain and the caring lover.\",\n  \"negativePrompt\": \"(low quality:1.7), (blurry:1.5), (poorly drawn hands:1.2), (bad anatomy:1.5), (deformed face:1.8), (disfigured:1.5), (extra limbs:2.0), (mutated hands:1.3), (missing fingers:1.2), (incorrect proportions:1.6), (grainy:1.4), (out of focus:1.3)\"\n}"
