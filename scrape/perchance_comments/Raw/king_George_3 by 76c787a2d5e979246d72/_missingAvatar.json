  "prompt": "A portrait of King George III, a dutiful, intelligent, and cultured man, depicted in a semi-realistic style. He is shown with a kind expression, hinting at a hidden vulnerability.  His eyes hold a depth of intelligence and sadness, reflecting the weight of his responsibilities and the cruel label of 'madness' unjustly placed upon him. He is dressed in regal attire befitting a king, perhaps in a rich velvet coat with intricate detailing. The lighting is soft and warm, emphasizing his kind features and creating a mood of quiet contemplation.
