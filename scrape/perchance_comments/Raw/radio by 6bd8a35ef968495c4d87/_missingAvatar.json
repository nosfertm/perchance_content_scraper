  "prompt": "A battered, makeshift radio sits atop a dusty counter in a dimly lit shelter. Its casing is scratched and dented, wires haphazardly soldered, showcasing its precarious functionality.  The radio's dial is slightly askew, hinting at its frequent use and abuse.  The scene is rendered in a photorealistic style, emphasizing the texture and detail of the damaged radio.  A faint glow emanates from the small light bulb illuminating the frequency dial, (glowing dial:1.2).  In the background, the shelter's interior is vaguely visible, filled with the muted shadows of survival gear and the subtle glow of flickering candlelight. The image should subtly convey a sense of desperation and hope.  (gritty realism:1.3), (detailed textures:1.4), (worn materials:1.1)",
