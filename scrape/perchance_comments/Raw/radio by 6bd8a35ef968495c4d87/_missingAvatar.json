The radio is crafted from scavenged parts, wires haphazardly connected, showing signs of wear and tear.  The focus is on the radio's physical state: (worn metal casing:1.2), (exposed wiring:1.1), (tattered fabric covering:1.0),  (scratched dial:1.1).  Surrounding the radio are various survival tools: (rusted can opener:0.8), (empty water bottle:0.7), (torn map:0.9). The scene is lit by a single flickering (candle:1.0), casting long, dramatic shadows. The overall style should be (photorealistic:1.5) with a (gritty, post-apocalyptic atmosphere:1.3).  A faint glow emanates from the radio's dial, suggesting a received signal. The overall mood should be (desolate:1.2), (tense:1.1), (hopeful:0.8).  In the background, blurred and out of focus are hints of the shelter's interior: (stacked crates:0.7), (sleeping bags:0.6), (shadows of other survivors:0.5).",
