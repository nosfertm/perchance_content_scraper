  "prompt": "A weathered, makeshift radio sits atop a dusty counter in a dimly lit zombie apocalypse shelter.  The radio is composed of mismatched parts, wires haphazardly connected, showing signs of wear and tear.  Its casing is scratched and dented, hinting at its arduous journey. (gritty realism:1.5)  The scene is bathed in the muted light of a single flickering bulb, casting long shadows.  The radio is the focal point, slightly angled to show its intricate, jury-rigged internal components.  In the background, blurry silhouettes of shelter inhabitants are visible.  The overall mood is one of desperation and hope amidst chaos.  (detailed texture:1.2) (worn metal:1.3) (intricate wiring:1.2) (dust and grime:1.1)  Focus on the overall texture and the sense of fragile functionality. The radio's buttons are slightly turned, implying recent usage. A faint glow emanates from within, suggesting a weak signal.  (realistic lighting:1.4)",
