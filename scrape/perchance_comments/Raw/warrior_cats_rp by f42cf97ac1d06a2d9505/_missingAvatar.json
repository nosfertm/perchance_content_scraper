"{\n  \"prompt\": \"A detailed digital painting of a cat, reminiscent of the Warrior Cats style, perched atop a pile of crowfood at Carrionplace, a Twoleg dump.  The cat's fur is matted and dirty, reflecting the harsh conditions (dirt-caked fur:1.2), but their eyes retain a fierce glint (determined gaze:1.3).  They are a lean, muscular build (powerful physique:1.1), suggesting a skilled hunter, despite their surroundings. The background features the decaying remains of a monster-kill, casting long shadows (ominous shadows:0.9).  The overall atmosphere is one of grim survival (desolate landscape:1.1) and quiet resilience. The lighting is dramatic, highlighting the cat's features (dramatic lighting:1.2), and emphasizing the textures (detailed textures:1.2) of their fur and the surroundings. The style is a blend of semi-realism and the stylized features of Warrior Cats illustrations.\",\n  \"negativePrompt\": \"(blurry:1.5), (low quality:1.8), (deformed:1.7), (bad anatomy:1.7), (poorly drawn hands:1.5), (missing limbs:1.8), (extra limbs:2.0), (disfigured:1.6)\"\n}"
