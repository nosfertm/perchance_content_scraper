  "prompt": "A detailed digital painting of a ShadowClan cat in the harsh, realistic environment of Carrionplace, a Twoleg dump in the forest.

The background includes the dimly lit surroundings of the (dumpster:1.3) and the distant, shadowy (forest trees:0.8), casting a melancholic light on the scene. The overall style should be realistic yet gritty and detailed, evocative of the bleakness of the setting, with strong (atmospheric lighting:1.2) and sharp focus on the cat's (expressive eyes:1.3).",
